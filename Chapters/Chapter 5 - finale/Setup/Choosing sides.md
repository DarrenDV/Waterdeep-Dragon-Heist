### Waking up
The party wakes up after heisting the final eye and having met the mayor of waterdeep.

As they arrive downstairs a gazer floats into the bar from the back entrance.
It exclaims: "The Xanathar wants to meet with you, to congratulate you on successfully dealing revenge on the buffoons that stole from him and to discuss your next course of action."

The party can choose to go with the gazer towards xanathar or go later. If they do decide to not go to xanathar at all, that will be seen as an automatic declaration of war. 


RP WHATEVER



### Arriving at Xanathar

The party arrives back at xanathars hideout, being cheered on by goons in the hall congratulating the party on their accomplishments. The morale is high and everyone is in good spirits. 

When arriving at xanathars office, he seems happy, having set a couple of glasses of fine dwarven brandy on his desk for the party to partake in. Sylgar the fish has recently been fed a bunch of fish treats and is muching on them as hard as he can. In front of the fishbowl however, a darker spot remains on the floor. 
He says "Yeah the cleaning crew is having some issues getting your friend out of the floor, his dust is really tough to get rid of."

"Huh.. who are you?" as he points to Marcellus

"Whatever"

"But thanks for coming everyone, you guys made a SHOW out of it, seeing an explosion that big brought was so beautiful it brought a tear to my eye."
"However it is time to talk business, I've learned that the mayor, miss Silverhand, has paid you a visit. I'm guessing about the stone, the eyes and the vault?"


CONVO A BIT


"I obviously would like to keep our alliance strong, Waterdeep could be ours, Mine AAAANNDD Yours, to rule if we get to the vault."
"I'd like to discuss with everyone privately to see what we can manage to do if that were fine with you."


### Xanathars deals
##### Cedric
"An out of city kid arriving at waterdeep to get revenge for what a cult did to his village and saving his parents. Even succeeding at the task. They write fictional books about that you know."
"Do you really want to let the city in control, who not only never publicly discovered this cult, but probably knew about it and let it thrive due to corruption and greed?"
"Side with me and we can keep the citizens of waterdeep save, cults are bad for my business so I'd like to keep them out. If you want you could have a high governmental position to keep those avernus loving demons out of waterdeep forever, Cedric the exorcist. Of course I'll make sure you, your family and anyone else you want would be favourably accommodated in the city."

"Please do keep this to yourself, if this does seem like something you want and you share this with the group and they don't want this alliance, you'll be the black sheep in no time. Show your decision when it matters with actions."

##### Siebren
"An student wanting to learn as much as he can about the echo dimension, getting kicked out of every library and university because his work was dangerous and unethical. Is that a city you see yourself living in?"
"Even if you get your research station, thats just a compromise, their opinions on your work will never change and the first chance they get to kick you out will be theirs for the taking."
"Under me you're truly free to do what you'd like"

"Please do keep this to yourself, if this does seem like something you want and you share this with the group and they don't want this alliance, you'll be the black sheep in no time. Show your decision when it matters with actions."

##### Old man
"I disintegrated your pupil and you're here for revenge, how nice."
"I'm going to be honest... I don't know you and you're fairly new so I can only think of one thing to offer you if you join my side. We'll bring that slime back."
"Think about is... " he winks with his singular eye

"Please do keep this to yourself, if this does seem like something you want and you share this with the group and they don't want this alliance, you'll be the black sheep in no time. Show your decision when it matters with actions."

##### Robot
"An automaton created by the city to upheld law, but kicked to the curb when he wasn't good enough."
"The city thinks to highly of themselves, have you seen how many criminals flourish in this city? I mean look at me HAHAHAHA". 
"I simply believe the city needs new management, someone with an honest heart... or chip... to handle affairs."
"Management like that needs a judge, jury and executioner, so what do you say?"

"Please do keep this to yourself, if this does seem like something you want and you share this with the group and they don't want this alliance, you'll be the black sheep in no time. Show your decision when it matters with actions."

##### Lucyus
"With the others I had something special to say, something to maybe win them over..."
"But I don't have that for you because you already know"
"At my side, you'll not be alone anymore, you'll have your sister with you. The city is not going to allow that, the first chance they get they'll strip that entire vault empty including whatever you all have with you, I have spies you know about, theirs you don't."

"Please do keep this to yourself, if this does seem like something you want and you share this with the group and they don't want this alliance, you'll be the black sheep in no time. Show your decision when it matters with actions."

### After xanathars discussions
"Thanks for talking with me everyone, I'm sure you need some time to think. I'll contact you guys later regarding the vault."







### Arriving back at the bar
A wagon with horse is parked outside the bar
Upon arriving back at the bar a well dressed gentleman is seated at the bar. He perks up and rushes towards the party.


"Where have you people been!?!? The mayor wants to talk to you!"

RP it out

He has a wagon with horse waiting outside


### Arriving at the castle
For how long the party have been in waterdeep, the castle has never been a destination, until now. A large castle is sat atop the side of Mount Waterdeep with a winding path going through numerous guardposts towards the main building. The structure is by far the biggest in the entirety of waterdeep. With a courtyard bigger than some of the city's parks. The carriage circles the courtyard on one of the most maintained roads in the city and stops on the other side. A door multiple floors in height is slightly opened and the mayor's hand points you towards the opening. 

"Please enter" he proclaims. 

The door leads to a large room, filled with guards, nobles and servants all talking to one another. The room is decorated beautifully, with 30 feet high drapes dangling from the ceiling. Carpets imported from exotic countries. And fine art filling the entire walls. On the other side of the room the mayor is seated in a large red throne, staring at you. 



### Talking to the mayor
"Greeting gentleman, I'm glad you could come. I thought it to be of the utmost importance to see where you have landed on the partnership regarding the vault and to see if perhaps we can make a deal. It has come to my knowlegde that Xanathar has done the same, and it would feel unfair if I were not able to see if we can accommodate your needs. I'd like to speak with you all privately, so already-corrupted individuals won't try to interfere in your wishes."

"You Robot... Please follow me to my meeting room. The rest of you can relax yourselfs out here, mingle with the other guests if you'd like, and if you need anything be sure to ask the servants."


#### Entering the meeting room
A small room to the side of the main hall is decorated like a library. In the middle of the room a large circular wooden table with a couple of luxurious chairs around it is placed. A small halfling is already seated on one side of the table, the mayor sits next to him and points to a chair opposite them.
"Please do take a seat..."

##### Robot
"You've done a lot for this city BOLT. We're very proud of you and how you managed to overcome your decommissioning. We have seen what you like to do for this city and would love to grant you a position as captain of your own squad, if you'd like that of course."
"What is a squad without members by the way? If you would grant the city the contents of the vault, I promise that if you'd want to, we'll produce more BOLT units that can be members of your squad. You'll be captain of around a dozen yous."
"I trust you'll make the right decision. But please don't share this with the rest, my spies believe one or more of you will definitely join Xanathars side. If you fight now the vault is far from guaranteed."

##### Cedric
"Mister Witlock, I know the circumstances on why you had to enter this city were far from ideal, and for that I'd like to express my sincerest apologies. But you overcame all odds and defeated the cassalanters, who had infinitely more resources than you did."
"I feel like you probably would want to go back to your hometown, so if that's the case. We'll use part of the funds from the vault to help your village back to it's older self."
"I trust you'll make the right decision. But please don't share this with the rest, my spies believe one or more of you will definitely join Xanathars side. If you fight now the vault is far from guaranteed."


##### Lucyus
"Who wouldve guessed that someone who murdered two officials would be speaking with the lord as a free man. You have had a hectic few months wouldnt you say?"
"I want to make sure you'll be able to live a happy live, whilst still adhering to your hectic nature. So how about we make sure that a portion of the vaults funds are used to rebuild your old village? Maybe upgrade it where needed. What do you say?"

Probably some RP here

"I trust you'll make the right decision. But please don't share this with the rest, my spies believe one or more of you will definitely join Xanathars side. If you fight now the vault is far from guaranteed."

##### Old man
"You I'm quite confused about. There were so few reports about you yet you're still a part of the group. I do know that you're a monk, so wouldnt it be nice if I could allocate some of the vaults funds towards an improved monestary. It could also go to whatever else you'd like. Just ask!"

Probably some RP here

"I trust you'll make the right decision. But please don't share this with the rest, my spies believe one or more of you will definitely join Xanathars side. If you fight now the vault is far from guaranteed."


##### Siebren
"I believe we already had a talk mr de kuiper. So I'll keep it short and sweet. I'm offering you a full government grant on doing research into your echo dimension. You'll be provided your own wizard tower and funds you need for your research. I know that you got rid of that Zhentarim gang in Kolat Towers, so that's where I'm currently thinking we'd be able to relocate you too. "

Probably some RP here

"I trust you'll make the right decision. But please don't share this with the rest, my spies believe one or more of you will definitely join Xanathars side. If you fight now the vault is far from guaranteed."




### Leaving the mayor
"Thanks a lot for showing up everyone, I do have some other business to attend to so I'm afraid I can't keep you company for much longer. If you have any remaining questions be sure to ask them now."


RP



"My servant will drive you back home in the carriage."
"I trust you'll make the right decision when time comes."

"Au reviour!" 



### Arriving back at the bar 2
When the party arrives back they can do whatever.

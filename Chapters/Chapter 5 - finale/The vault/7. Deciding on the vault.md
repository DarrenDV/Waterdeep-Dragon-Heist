The same route is fully available to go back in the vault. 

Inside the inner sanctum [[Renaer Neverember]] and Aurinax are waiting, talking to one another

	Hi everyone! It's great seeing you again! We're so proud of what you did.

Aurinax says 

	You truly represented my lords wishes, and for that I am grateful

As he says this renaer lets out a tear from his eye. 


	We have one last thing to decide 
Aurinax says

	What we're going to do with the contents of the vault.
	I know some of you have specific items in mind, and I'll be happy to assist in using them for your purposes.
	Gold ofcourse can be taken to your hearts content
	In regards to some of the more dangerous magic items; this vault hides them from the world, only having rumour be the lead for you to be here. I'd like to propose keeping the dangerous magic items in here, to keep them out of evil's hand. You could split the stone apart again and take or hide it seperately.

RP it out
Let the players decide what they want to do with the vaults content

Aurinax prefers to stay as the libraries guardian, having grown accustomed to living there

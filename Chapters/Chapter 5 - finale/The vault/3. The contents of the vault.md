### Talking with Aurinax
Once Aurinax is brought down to low enough hp, he'll revert back into his dwarven form and congratulate the players on their success.

	We'll I'd have to say I'm happily suprised, that was a good brawl we had. Let me introduce myself truthfully now, my name is Aurinax and I'm a good friend of Neverember, who are you?

	What brings you to the vault?

	Around a decade ago, Lord neverember saw evil rise throughout the whole gold coast. Evil gangs, guilds and cults began gaining control over land, gaining resources and powers with it. Neverember suspected that at some point evil powers would gain such a prominent position that they would gain access to Waterdeeps vast library of magical items and funds, vast enough to support an army in subjegating the entire gold coast. He decided to slowly but surely seal those powerful artifacts and a large amount of dragons away here, where it couldnt be touched. Until now.

	Whilst I am obliged to act as your vaults librarian, I would humbly request that you wouldnt bring the items and funds from within here to evil.

	Are there any items you're looking for specifically?


Let people ask about items, ask why they're asking. If anyone says that they need the items for a deal say the following.

	You understand that this Xanathar will probably have a plan to screw you over once you hold up to your end of the bargain?

	He'll bring your friend back to life? Necromancy?
	I do think that he'll probably keep that cult item safe so they wont get ahold of it.
	Your sister will probably be given a new life, but as a puppet of xanathars.


	I understand that you want to achieve your goals, but enabling the corrupt lord/the crime boss, will put waterdeep and its citizens more at risk. May I suggest another option? Deny them their greedy goals and stop them, it's what lord neverember would have wanted to I'll be happy to be of assistance in your battle against him. 



The players can choose here if they want to team up with Aurinax against the other parties. If they do decide to do so say the following:

	The dwarf looks delighted when you dedice to support his cause, showing a gentle smile across his face. He holds his left hand away from him, pointing his fingers in your general direction. From each of his fingertips a small stream of fire emerges going towards everyone individually. The streams of flames slowly snake their way towards you. When it almost reaches you it starts to circle you, going up and down in a spiraling motion, never touching you but enegerizing you. You slowly start to glow, increasing in brightness as you feel more energized. He stops his process and you feel way more refreshed afterwards, ready for whatever comes up next.




You restore all health and spell slots. You gain 10 temp hp. You feel more focused, being able to add a +2 or 2 +1's to any ability modifier for the next in game hour. Lastly you also gain an aura providing +1 to every saving throw for the next hour.


The players can only use the items from within the vault after everything is over due to restrictions.

	I'm afraid you'll only be able to use the items after we did our business, they take longer than the time we have




	Do whatever you feel you must, we'll look for them when you're ready.

The dragonstaff, held by the librarian. This staff holds the power to control lesser dragons across the swords coast. Right now it's permanently used to keep dragons out of waterdeep, protecting the city. It could also be used to launch an offensive against whoever would be so unlucky to be on the other end.

Wand of watchmen. This wand can be used to control the large statue like watchmen dotted around waterdeep.

The husk of a puppet. This empty puppet husk looks like a doll that hasn't been detailed yet into it's final design. It can hold a soul to grant that soul a new body.

The husk of a puppet's strings. A puppet can be controlled. Anyone who holds the strings has complete control over the puppet.

Stone of returnal x3. A stone can be used to retrieve an item from anywhere toward the stone. The returned item can be any (meta)physical object from any plane of existence.

The stone is fragile and is instantly destroyed if hit by 13 or more bludgeoning damage in 1 attack.

### Items the factions are interested in
[[Bregan D'aerthe]] , the circus of innovations was mostly interested in the promise of large amounts of gold and the numerous magic items the vault holds, maybe being able to copy and sell them.
The [[Zhentarim]] were after the vault for the large amounts of coin, being able to fund more troops in the war against the mad mage down below.
The [[Cassalanters]] heard rumours about the crown of horns inside of the vault.
[[Xanathar Guild]]  is after the dragonstaff, wand of watchmen, and the puppets strings. He wants all the power so nobody can stop him.

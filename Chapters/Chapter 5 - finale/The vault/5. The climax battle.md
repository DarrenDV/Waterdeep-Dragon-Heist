As the party ventures outside the shining light of the sun blinds them temporarily. As their eyes adjust to the sun blobs of people appear around 80 feet away on opposite ends. It's Xanathar and Silverhand having a standoff. 

In front of them are platoons of guild members and nobility of multiple rankings, some dead on the ground. They we're just talking to eachother but that got cut off noticing you left the catacombs.

Before anyone has the chance to speak Xanathar screams

	THE ITEMS, BRING THEM TO ME NOW, I'LL GRANT YOU WHAT YOU WANTED RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. 

The mayor interjects

	No bring me the items! You know what promises we made, think of all the promises I gave to you, the city'll be in your eternal debt.


Aurinax turns to the party and says.

	Now is the time to show your true side, but if you truly want to save this city, give me the sign and we'll end this with glorious combat!


The players are free here to show their true loyalty.

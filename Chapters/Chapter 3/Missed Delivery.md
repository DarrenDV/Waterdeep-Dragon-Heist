The party awakens as they are getting tied up, gagged, bag over their head and cuffed. In the case of [[Stickey Mickey]], he gets put in a keg. The party can attempt a save, but due to the surprising nature of the attack, they have disadvantage. When they failed they're also stripped of all gear.

A couple of hours later their blindfolds and gags are magically removed. The party finds themselves inside of an underground prison cell. Standing on the other side of the bars a familiar face displays itself; That of Victoro [[Cassalanters]]. 

"Hello again, I'm not sure if you're aware, but it has been some time after you stole that stone, the one you were going to steal for us remember? And yet we still don't have it in our possession. And on top of that someone has been meddling with some my family's side businesses. That wouldnt be you... right? "

"Here's the deal, you are untrustworthy in our eyes and have fulfilled your use to us. Your bodies might still have some other value for our side business however, you'll be worked on first thing tomorrow. Enjoy your last evening."

Victoro and his entourage leave following this discussion. 


### How to leave this damn place

After Victoro and the direct guards have left a voice can be heard from a cell to the right of the party. A gruff voice calls out to them:
"New faces here? Why did they capture you?"
"Names [[Brok]], I'm a spy sent in the name of Lord Neverember but they got me a few days ago."

[[Brok]] 's knowlegde:
* He is a rock gnome spy sent in the name of Lord Neverember to attempt a recovery of the [[Stone of Golorr]] and it's corresponding eyes
* He has colleagues working in the [[Zhentarim]] faction and the [[Xanathar Guild]] 
* He was caught a few days ago, work got out there might have been a spy and following an investigation he was found
* It is of utmost importance that the Cult of HC does not retrieve all 3 eyes and the stone, as that could unleash a catastrophy on the city
	* Their children are dying and to save them they have made a pact with a devil, but the devil is simply using them and they refuse to acknowledge this
		* They've murdered people for simply speaking against their plan
	* It is said the vault contains an item needed for "the ritual to save their children"
* If the party can escape and bring Brok with them, he can help them work on a plan to take back the eyes and the stone. 
	* This gives the party the mission to escape the dungeon they're currently in
* Brok has no knowledge of how to actually escape the dungeon, as he and everyone else is normally brought in blind
* Brok does guess there are around 10 guards scattered around the dungeon
* The party and Brok's gear is probably near the entrance of the dungeon 

##### Situation report

[[Witlock]] is missing all his equipment

The party needs to find a way to escape their cuffs and their cell. 

The guard possessing the keys to the cuffs and cell is posted outside the cell ward. 

Let the players RP any way to get free. 


### Leaving the dungeon 
The party needs to get past a couple of rooms to escape. These rooms are as follows:

```statblock
monster: Thug
```
```statblock
monster: Dretch
```

##### Q1
Prison cells containing Brok and the party

##### Q2 
Contains a singular thug holding a key to the cuffs and cell doors of Q1
The thug has a handaxe and shortbow and medium hide armor

##### Q3
Holds 5 more cells with prisoners, has 2 patrolling guards, one thug and one apprentice wizard. The thug has a hand crossbow and mace and is wearing ring mail.  
The apprentice wizard has an spellbook containing:
		lv1: Mage armor, shield & magic missile
		lv2: scorching ray & maximillians earthen grasp
A couple of vents are also routed through Q3, but unfortunately they have collapsed further down, supplying no means of escape

##### Q4
Q4 is a hallway that connects the main prison area to rooms Q5 and Q6 and through a locked door to Q7. The key to Q7 is held by the main patrolling guard here. He is chilling in Q6.

##### Q5
Q5 is a ritual room where prisoners are sacrificed to be turned into cult aiding monsters. You can find a thug maintaining 2 dretch who've just recently transformed. The thug carries a rapier and longbow and a chain shirt

##### Q6
Q6 is the main guard room here where they can relax and chill. Here the main guard and another thug are present. The main thug has a +2 on AC, +1 on attack and +10 health. He also carries the keys to Q7 and wields a greataxe and has 1 potion of healing. The normal thug carries a longsword.

##### Q7
Q7 connects to the end of the dungeon and has an additional hallway to Q8. The southward way goes toward another map of the dungeon, this way is locked however, requiring a key the warden has. The eastbound way requires the same key owned by the warden and leads to the sewers of waterdeep. When the party attempts to head southbound, Brok is adamant that that is the wrong choice and they should head eastbound. Both directions are marked by signs as to where they lead. The westbound direction leads to the wardens office.

##### Q8
Q8 is the main office and lockup of the cults prison. Here the warden and 2 of his minions are talking about the captured party and their stuff that is stored in the back of the room. The warden carries the key needed to leave the prison using either exit. He carries a pouch containing 100gp

### Escaping the prison 
When escaping through the sewers the party find quickly find a ladder going up. Using said ladder places them inside of an alley with vision on cassalanter villa. Using the previous knowlegde it is safe to assume that the prison they were just in was underneath cassalanter villa. 

Brok tells the party it's probably a good idea to regroup and quickly think of a plan back at the parties bar.
Whilst possible the worry for another cassalanter raid isn't all that high because they now know we can expect one. They'll be more cautious with attacking us. 



### Arriving at the stolen gem
Brok initiates dialogue:
"Well guys I have to say I'm really thankful for helping me get out of there. I'd probably be dead meat otherwise. Unfortunately the works far from done. Please do retrieve the stone and the eyes, failing to do so could literally mean the end of waterdeep as we know it. I know it's much to ask but I'd be willing to assist in any way I can, for instance with planning."

Have some conversation

"Our goal will be to initiate a heist against the [[Xanathar Guild]], [[Zhentarim]] and [[Cassalanters]]. We'll need to heist as going in swords blazing will probably mean instant death. I've set up a quick board so we can get our plans straight."

The mission of the party will now be to initiate heists and do preparation missions to set up these heists. Missions are whatever the party deems necessary.

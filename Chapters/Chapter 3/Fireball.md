You return from the casino and almost arrive back at the stolen gem. You're around the corner from the street the bar is located at when you hear a loud bang. Windows rattle and screams can be heard coming from toward the bar. A thick cloud of smoke starts billowing upward into the air. Looking at where the smoke comes from, you can place it around right in front of the front door of your bar.

How do you react?

If the players want to find out what happens in the moment. They can recall that something similar happened, although on a smaller scale, when lucyus casted a fireball on himself in siebrens tower.


## Arriving at the scene
At the crime scene the party finds multiple charred corpses around the street in front of their bar. Including them is one of the children that played in the bar, the local blacksmith and an unidentified gnome. 

At this point end the session. No money roll. We dont end on a long rest.



# FIREBALL CONTINUATION
Begin recap laatste sessie

We ended with a fireball going off right in front of the door of the stolen gem, which happened just when you were about to walk around the corner to the street where it happened. 

When the players walk up say the following: 
"In the wake of the explosion, people emerge from their houses and shops to survey the devastation. The fireball didn't set any buildings ablaze, but it left 11 people dead:"
* One of the children playing on the street 
* Two cloaked male humans, armored but not wearing any specific factions emblem
* One male gnome, wearing a burned cloak and clutching a dagger, lying dead just in front of your door
* A bunch of other random people

The PCs only have a few minutes to search around before the guards arrive to investigate the crime scene 

A PC can investigate the gnome to discover that he's spent a long time in the sewers, he also carries a pouch with 500 gold which is hard to steal because the people are looking.


### The watch arrives
Twenty minutes after the explosion, a City Watch sergeant escorts a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors  to the crime scene. The magist quietly takes charge of the investigation at that point, while Sergeant directs a force of twenty constables ( veterans) to knock on doors and question locals. Before allowing the corpses to be removed and taken to local temples, magist inspects the scene closely and reaches the following conclusions, which he prefers to keep to himself but might share with other members of the Watchful Order:

• The gnome was running from armed pursuers, of which there were three. The third person who was chasing the gnome isn't among the dead. 
• The gnome and his pursuers were moving toward the tavern in Trollskull Alley
• Neither the gnome nor his pursuers saw the blast coming

Given these findings, Barnibus decides to question the tavern's owners and occupants, with Sergeant Cromley by his side as a witness and bodyguard. Specifically, Barnibus wants to find out the gnome's identity and whether he was known to anyone. The characters, having never met Dalakhar, have little information to offer unless they decide to lie.
Neither Barnibus nor Sergeant Cromley is quick to jump lo conclusions. They both prefer to have ironclad evidence and testimony from reliable witnesses before making any arrests. Even though the characters are suspects by virtue of their proximity to the crime scene. it hardly seems plausible that they would unleash destructive magic so close to their place of business in broad daylight. Consequently, Barnibus intends not to take up too much of their time. Barnibus and Sergeant Cromley refuse requests by characters to join the investigation. "That would introduce too many new variables into an already confounding equation," replies Barnibus with a frown. "Trust in the Watch," Cromley adds dismissively. Characters who seem truthful and honest can press Barnibus for further information by making a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they nudge Barnibus into revealing what he has discovered, as outlined above.


### Eyewitnessess
Many other people witnessed the fireball without being caught in the blast. 
Three of them have important infor- mation to share. 
Any character who spends at least 1 minute talking to one of them learns what that person saw or heard. (No ability checks are required, since the eyewitnesses are eager to talk.) 

FALA LEFALIJR 
Fala, the owner of Corellon's Crown (see chapter 2, areaT4). 
relates the following information: 
"I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn't injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome. then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail." 
Pala saw Urstul Floxin fleeing the scene with the Stone of Golorr in his clutches. He circled around the Bent Nail (see chapter 2. area T2) on his way out of Trollskull Alley.

JEZRYNNE HORNRAVENA 
Waterdavian born of wealth and privilege. 
jezrynne was leaving the Tiger's Eye (see chapter 2, area TS), 
having just hired Vincent Trench to spy on her philandering husband, when she witnessed the following: 
"I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!" 
Jezrynne doesn't know what the "puppet" hurled to cause the fireball. She took her eyes off the thing during the chaos and doesn't know where it went.
A character with waterdavian descent should be asked to do a history check which reveals that the description odlly matches one of the automatons from the Day of wonders parade. The same parade being held at the circus of innovations.



MARTEM TREC 
This 12-year-old boy watched as his halfning friends perished in the flames. 
He didn't see much beyond that, but he found something important after the blast went off: ] "
Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. ] Then I heard a 'plop' and found this in the barrel." 
Martem produces a necklace of fireballs with two beads remaining and a broken clasp. 
As it fled across a roof- top, the nimblewright accidentally yanked on the neck- lace. which came off, fell to the roof, slid off the edge, and plopped into the rain barrel next to Martem. 
He doesn't know what to make of this object but was planning to keep it. 
A character can snalch it from him or convince Martem to relinquish it with a successful DC 8 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. 
Characters who withhold the necklace, and knowl- edge of it, from the City Watch are guilty of a crime in Waterdeep. Hampering justice by concealing evidence can result in a fine of up to 200 gp and hard labor for up to a tenday.


### Speaking with the victims
After the party has finished speaking with the victims they can see the victims being transported off towards the morgue. When questioning the guards the following information can be aqcuired: 
Clerics from local temples are brought in to cast gentle repose spells on the corpses, to preserve them while the investigation is ongoing.

Any character who has a renown of 1 or higher in Force Grey (the Gray Hands) or the Harpers can petition their faction representative to hire a cleric to cast speak with dead on one or more of the fatalities.
The characters can hire a cleric themselves by making a donation of at least 25 gp to the cleric's temple for each casting of the spell. They must also provide a list of questions they want answered. A speak with dead spell can pry some or all of the fol - lowing information from Dalakhar's corpse if the right questions are asked:

• Dalakhar stole an artifact called the Stone ofGolorr from the lair of a beholder known as Xanathar, in a dungeon deep below the city. 
•Dalakhar worked for the Open Lord of Waterdeep. (Here he refers to Lord Dagult Neverember, whom he believes is the rightful Open Lord, not Laeral Silverhand.) 
•The Stone of Golorr is the key to finding a hoard of dragons hidden in the city. 
•Dalakhar heard about a group of adventurers who rescued Lord Neverember's son from the Zhentarim and thought the Stone of Golorr would be safe in their hands for the time being. He was on his way to deliver it to them, planning to come back and reclaim it after he had eluded his pursuers. Then the fireball went off

The following information can be learned by casting speak with dead on one or both of the dead Zhentarim sellswords: 
Their names were Bashekk Ortallis and Wern Malkrave. 
They worked for Urstul Floxin and resided al Gralhund Villa. 
Their job was to help catch a gnome named Dalakbar. 
Dalakhar had some kind of artifact in his possession which, according to Urstul Floxin, would make them as rich as kings.



# WHAT NOW
From this point onward the party might be able to deduce that they should visit the circus of innovations. If they dont however, they can spend the rest of their time doing whatever, they can contact the detective to maybe help them or just wait on the next thing to happen.

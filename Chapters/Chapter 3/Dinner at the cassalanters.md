After returning from whatever thing the party is doing, they find the bar has been left an invite for "Dinner at Cassalanter Villa." The invitation is dated for tonight and seems to only be directed at the party.

A PC with knowledge of waterdeep can remember that the cassalanters are a rich noble familly owning multiple banks and other financial establishments. Over the years however, the family has been known to lose a lot of money but won't disclose why in their financial records. 

## Arriving at cassalanter villa
Arriving at cassalanter villa you see an opulent mansion characterized by its grand architecture and lavish decorations. Situated in the sea ward, the villa features well-manicured gardens, marble columns, and intricate wrought-iron gates. The exterior exudes wealth and nobility, while the interior is adorned with fine art, luxurious furnishings, and a sense of aristocratic elegance. The entire premises consist of multiple buildings with one main mansion at the front. 

A servant at the gate sees the party and waves them in.
"Welcome to Cassalanter Villa gents, inside you'll be escorted to the dining hall, miss and missus cassalanter have some important business to discuss with you."


When walking toward the dining hall, the two twins can be seen running past the player characters, one of them accidentally bumping into Cedric. This touch induces a cold sense, almost as if something is wrong with the kid. Before cedric has any chance to act the kid has already said sorry and ran away. 


## Meeting the cassalanters
When walking into the dining room Victoro and Ammalia are already seated at the table, victoro stands up and greets the guests: "Welcome gentlemen, welcome to our estate, please do take a seat, dinner shall be served shortly. My name is Victoro Cassalanter, head of the cassalanter family. This is my wife Ammalia. We do also have 2 children, but they're playing somewhere. Who might you all exactly be?"

Let the party talk and shit

Meanwhile roleplay some servants carrying food


After some time or when prompted about the invite

"The reason for your invitation is that you've been thrown into a little game of ours, and whilst that damage has already been done, you might prove to be the way we get the upper hand. Would you be interested in joining our game as an ally?"

In conversation reveal the following:
* The game refers to a battle around an artifact called the Stone of Golorr
* The reason the party was chosen is because after the work they've done for the city, they've earned a good reputation, and allies are better than enemies. 
* The explosion around the tavern was directed at a gnome carrying the stone 
* The stone has been in and out of multiple hands, those being the [[Cassalanters]] , the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Xanathar Guild]] s'. 
* The stone opens a vault of dragons hidden somewhere in the city, rumor has it it's at least 500.000 dragons and magic artifacts. 
* From what the cassalanters know, a unknown 4th party took the stone at the explosion. 
* They won't tell why they need the stone. 
* If the party can retrieve the stone for the cassalanters, they will pay them 10% of the haul. 
* Some of the cassalanter hirelings have heard reports about the automaton that worked with the thieves, it is the key priority to find out who sent it.

Just continue talking and roleplaying dinner

After the conversation has concluded "Thanks for coming over for dinner and accepting / thinking over our proposal. We do have some more business to attend to so I'm afraid this is where our meeting is going to end. Some servants will show you the door."
"Please do return once you have obtained the stone. Thanks again"

When walking back out of the building the party walks past the stairs again. Both twins are standing on the stairs, eying the party down, cedric gets a weird feeling. 
Before he is able to act, the kids run back up the stairs and the party continues to get escorted outside. 



## Back at the bar
Returning back at the bar the party gets confronted by a xanathar squad sent to retrieve lucyus' [[Stone of split persona]] . The squad consists of 3 apprenctice wizards, 3 thugs and 2 dogs.

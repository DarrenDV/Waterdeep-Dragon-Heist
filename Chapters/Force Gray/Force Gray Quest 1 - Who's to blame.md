The party arrives at force gray hq and is greeted by captain staget who seems to be in a hurry, talking to a bunch of people from different branches of force gray. 

"Hey gang! Great you could come. We need your help escorting a transport of some restricted files and items. A couple of years ago we did the same and got raided so we want you to provide security as an extra added precaution. If everything ends up well you'll be paid handsomely. "


The convoy exists of 5 carts. The middle 3 of which will be transporting the cargo. You'll be placed on the back cart to defend the rear from any possible attacks. 

Staget cant disclose the contents of the carts if he thinks he doesnt need to

The carts contain information being sent to the archive:



CART INFO
The 2nd and 3rd cart contain items of importance to Force Gray, be it illegal items or evidence for cases.

The first cart carries archival type documentation about things that have happened in waterdeep and force gray. 
Make up some shit
some other notable ones are:
* Documentation about a "grand game" some illegal spies have talked about, nothing is clear on what this entails and the information scarce in the folder.
* Information about the Xanathar and Zhentarim, diving deeper into their gang war and why it could be happening. Linking evidence and crimes commited by the factions
* Reports on a force gray carriage heist a couple of years back. The most important stolen goods from back then were automaton blueprints. Added notes are present on how only the prototype was made of these robots and the program was discontinued after the theft.
* Blueprints of new experimental weapons, including some ranged weapons such as the [[Bouncefire Launcher]] 




Just rp the shit out.




### Escorting the carts 
The players are placed on the back cart of the convoy. Some guards on horses accompany them. 

Let them RP for a little while

After some time the party moves towards a quieter part of the city, near the dock ward. 

The party crosses a longer street with no split off paths except for some alleys. All of a sudden 2 drow appear behind on horseback, nearing the back cart where the party are located. The cart suddenly does an emergency break. Looking towards the front of the convoy, a large force wall can be seen blocking the 2nd and 3rd carriage off from one another. On the rooftops around the party a couple of archers jump out, pointing bows at the party. And 2 nimblewrights jump down towards the carriages. Fighting can be heard coming from the front carriages but due to their distance and the force wall, they're inaccessible. 

The assailants will not kill anyone due to that putting them higher on a wanted list. 

The players have x amount of turns to defeat their own assailants, dismantle the force wall, and help the fight on the other side. If they don't achieve this in those amount of turns, the first cargo cart will be stolen.


In the ruckus, a couple of items drop out from the middle cart. Multiple being in secured vaults but The [[Bouncefire Launcher]] being broken open by accident.




Regardless of outcome the next follows
They'll somehow return to force gray to discuss what happened. Staget will be dissapointed (if they lost the cart) but hopefully with the help of the party they can figure out who did it. He goes over the cargo manifest to discuss why the thieves would have targeted carriage 1 specifically. 

The party is hopefully able to deduce that [[Bregan D'aerthe]] was behind the attack. Staget will send the party off to rest and will be trying to recover internal operations so they can send a full out assault later towards the HQ of [[Bregan D'aerthe]].

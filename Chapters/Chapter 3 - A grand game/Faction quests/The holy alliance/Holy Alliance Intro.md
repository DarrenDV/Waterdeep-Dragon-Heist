##### When walking up

As the party makes their way through the winding streets of Waterdeep, with the goal of visiting the church, you find yourselves standing before an imposing and majestic structure: the Church of Tyr. The sight before you is one of solemn grandeur and a testament to the values of law, order, and justice upheld by the followers of the god Tyr.

The church is a formidable stone edifice, its architecture a blend of Romanesque and Gothic styles. Its facades are adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures that depict scenes of justice, valor, and righteousness. Two massive oak doors, each bearing the symbol of a balanced set of scales, open to the main entrance. 

Above the entrance, a massive stained glass window catches your eye. It depicts a radiant golden gauntlet, the symbol of Tyr, gripping a set of scales. Sunlight streams through the colored glass, casting a dazzling mosaic of light across the stone floor of the church's entry hall. The presence of the divine seems to hover in the air as you cross the threshold.


##### Interior 
The interior is equally impressive. The entry hall is vast and bathed in the same celestial light filtering through the stained glass window. The ceiling soars high overhead, adorned with intricate arches and holy symbols. Along the walls, you see masterfully crafted frescoes that depict stories of heroes and champions who upheld the principles of justice and fought against tyranny.

Throughout the church, you see individuals in the distinctive vestments of the clergy, as well as congregants who have come to seek guidance, solace, or to make offerings. The atmosphere is one of reverence and quiet reflection, as people light candles and offer prayers for justice and guidance.

As you explore further, you hear the melodious strains of a choir rehearsing hymns of valor and righteousness. The church's acoustics allow the music to fill the entire space, creating a deeply moving and spiritual ambiance.

At the heart of the church is the central altar. It is a massive stone structure where priests and paladins of Tyr conduct their ceremonies and deliver sermons. A large, gilded statue of Tyr himself stands behind the altar, depicting the god as a stern but just figure holding a sword in one hand and the scales of justice in the other. You see what looks like the head priest discussing with some bishops.

### Talking with the priest
High Inquisitor Roland Thorne talks holy

"Greeting children of the gods. What brings you to the church of Tyr? Do you wish to make an offering, pray or absolve you sins?"

Praise BE

Just RP it out. 

Roland Thorne knows has the following info at his disposal:
* The churches have been at a constant war with the occult for as many centuries as he knows 
* Small cults form all the time but can easily be disposed of
* He was talking with the bishops because multiple churches have run out of resources such as funds for supplies and manpower
* The church can use any help it can get doing random odd-jobs for which they can pay coin.

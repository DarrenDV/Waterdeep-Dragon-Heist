The quest starts at the stolen gem where Somed gives a quick rundown of the building. 

"So I've asked some harpers to scout out the place, and whilst we don't know everything, we can do some assumptions."
"The back door you found is most likely used for transport, seeing as to how some trackers have found signs of frequent footsteps and scratchmarks. The door isn't guarded from the outside but possibly does have some guards closeby on the inside because of the nature of what's being carried."
"There are quite a couple of workers there, we presume guards."
"The casino floor consists of 2 floors, the second floor being a ring so to speak."
"The 2nd floor also has an office or security booth looking over the 2 casino floors."
"Your goal is to find a way to access their main base of operations, Skullport, and find magic items and such."

"I'll give you 200 gold now, so you can look like a regular patron. Upon coming back with information you'll get another 200."

The way you want to do it is completely up to you, good luck. 



## Arriving at the casino
Give them some visual descriptions of [[Shadowsong Casino]]. When walking in through the main entrance they are greeted by a desk clerk in a lobby type area. He'll request the party to part ways with their weapons and only then are permitted into the main casino floor. There is a guard present in the room as well. The clerk can identify Cedric, Bolt and Siebren as weapon carriers.

## Through the gates
Give the party a visual description of the inside of [[Shadowsong Casino]] 
The party finds themselves on the casino floor, where they can interact in the casino using [[Casino games & gambling mechanics]] . 
A clerk at the counter next to them will wave them over.
"Greetings to shadowsong guys! You seem like some new faces. I'm the congierge and clerk, you can exchange chips for coins here. If you want to play some games, we offer Blackjack, poker, roulette, lucky number seven, slots, aim on point, arena and a small games corner. We also have a bar in case you'd like some refreshments. If you have any questions, please do ask."


A PC that looks around can do a perception check. A high enough roll results in them seeing [[Nihiloor]] inside the office looking down at them, but not doing anything, simply observing.

## Backrooms
The backrooms of the casino consist of a couple of main rooms.

### Warehouse
A warehouse is located at the back of the building. The warehouse contains a staircase going down to the back entrance of the building.
There are numerous crates and barrels, filled with casino supplies. A total of 300 chips can be found here. The warehouse has a couple of guards patrolling and moving stuff around.

Another crate present in the room contains a bunch of invitations for selected warriors to fight in Xanathar's arena:

### Office 
The office is a large glass walled room which overlooks the main casino floor. This is where [[Nihiloor]] is present. If [[Lucyus]] goes down he will be dragged here. The office has another door on the same side as the entrydoor. This door leads to a small storage vault room that requires a key that nihiloor has to open. Inside of the vault are 2 items, both gems inside of glass containers. Aside from these 2 is also a pouch containing 200gp.


There is a desk in the room containing a map of the sewers showing an intricate path toward towards skullport.



If [[Lucyus]] is down, [[Nihiloor]] will attempt to retrieve the [[Stone of split persona]] and use it on [[Lucyus]] to gain control over lucy, whereupon he will attempt to flee. 

[[Gem of warding]] 
[[Stone of split persona]] 


Just play it out however. 

Whenever the party is done doing their thing go to [[Fireball]]

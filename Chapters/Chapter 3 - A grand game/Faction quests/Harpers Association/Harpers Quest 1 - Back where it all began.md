Finally ready for a quest are you? Great 

"So as I've told you the xanathar is essentially a large crime syndicate."
"They operate in multiple tiers so to speak. They have smaller hideouts like the one you've visited, following that they have what we call district bases, basically multiple hubs where hideout traffic meets, and up top their main hideout, a place called Skullport. Aside from their hideouts, we don't know the location of anything."

He draws a tree on a piece of paper.

The unfortunate part of this tree however, is that the branches and leaves continue to regrow as long as the seed isn't destroyed. The hideout you cleared is probably back up and running by now. 


Now onto the actual mission.

Some time back a harper stash of magic items was raided by what we presume is the xanathar. After doing some digging around we think that the items went through the dock ward, so we want to do a counter raid on their district base. We have no clue where that is however so you'll be going back to the hideout you cleared once to find anything you can to lead us to that district base. Please try to figure out what items they have and where their district base is.

As a reward you'll get 250 gold from us harpers. I know that isn't much, frankly we've had better times economically. But you get to keep anything you find, you will be stealing and breaking and entering but im sure that your guard bot wont mind right?.



The players know the general layout of the hideout

# Going to the hideout 
If the party goes to the hideout above ground, let them walk by [[Old Xoblob Shop]] again, noticing the same features and that a new beholder plushie is hanging in the window. 
If they talk with Xoblob about it, let him act a bit nervous

Just RP it out




# Hideout

Before entering the hideout they once again find themselves in a one way passage with a dozed off gazer in the middle

The players know the layout of the hideout so they're given that.

# Q8 and Q10
There are 3 rooms here, from top to bottom:

Top room contains some papers about Xanathars latest haul:

	Subject: Successful Heist on Harper Hideout - Xanathar Guild Report
	
	To the Illustrious Xanathar,
	
	I trust this missive finds you in good health and high spirits. I am pleased to report the successful execution of our recent heist on a prominent Harper hideout located in the heart of Waterdeep. Our nimble operatives skillfully infiltrated the premises, overcoming the Harpers' feeble attempts at protection.
	Now, onto the spoils of our venture! The haul is bountiful, and our coffers shall be enriched by the wealth of trinkets and treasures we have liberated from those insufferable Harpers. Among the notable items procured, I bring your attention to a peculiar artifact that caught my eye â€“ the "Stone of Split Persona."
	I am sure that this stone will prove quite useful in regards to that elf Nihiloor spotted.
	I have enclosed a detailed inventory of the rest of the loot, outlining valuable artifacts, magical trinkets, and a substantial sum of gold that will undoubtedly contribute to the continued prosperity of our esteemed guild.
	May the Xanathar's gaze ever guide us to triumph.
	
	Yours in loyal service, Noska Ur'Gray

[[XANATHAR GUILD REPORT.pdf]]



2nd Room contains some hints toward the district base
On a table you find some casino chips (100 chips) laying around and 2 papers

The first paper, with splats of blood on it, has the following legible text:
	... sources indicate that the elusive .... Guild has established a discreet presence within the city's ... ward district. Rumors point to a casino as a front, a place where shadows intertwine with the games of chance. Further investigation is warranted to pinpoint the exact location.

The 2nd papers, upon closer inspection, reveals itself to be a map
	A torn piece of a map reveals a layout of the city's dock ward district, with a discreet mark near the location of the casino. The mark is accompanied by the words, "Where Shadows Play." The mark surrounds around a whole neighbourhood.


The bottom room has a chest containing some gold (79) and a table with a paper.

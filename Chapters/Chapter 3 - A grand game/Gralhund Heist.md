The middle of the room serves as a sparring grounds for the main owners of the villa, those being an orc named Hrabbaz, 1 nimblewright, who are perpetually sparring. Hrabbaz holds the key to the safe hidden inside the master bedroom. And 250gp.

When the nimblewright falls, a whirring noise can be heard coming from it's chest cabinet. Upon closer inspection a crystal can be seen producing the noise. When looking inside of the crystal the party can see the face or Jarl from [[Bregan D'aerthe]] looking at them, now knowing whats up.

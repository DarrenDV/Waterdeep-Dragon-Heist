[[The Saving of Stickey Mickey]] is a side quest with the goal of retrieving some ingredients for a cure for [[Stickey Mickey]] 's current condition, being a full blown rat. The quest entails travelling to an old, seemingly abandoned alchemist's tower, finding the ingredients in said tower and bringing them back to the lady of plagues in waterdeep to create a cure. 


# On the way
The party finds themselves a couple of miles outside of the forest the party suddenly feels a shiver through their spine, as they get surrounded by a thick mist. Suddenly the group hears a bunch of croaking noises coming from all angles. The party finds themselves facing 4 twig blights, 2 needle blights and 1 vine blight.

Whilst they have nothing of value, a character can see (however they'd like) that these blights are quite humanoid, more than what they'd expect from awakened plants. 



Possibly end the session here depending on the time. 


# Arriving at the settlement
After a couple days worth of travel you arrive at a small settlement outside of a forest, the forest wherein the alchemist's tower presumably lies. The settlement is not marked on your map. 

You see a couple of homes, an inn, a forge and some guard posts. These guard posts are however not located at your side of the town, but the border between the forest and the town. 
Most of the buildings are made out of old wood, seemingly at least a couple of decades old. The only reinforced structure in sight are the small guard towers at the border with the forest. 
You do see some people walking around, but the town's population won't exceed 100 people, even with you in it. Whilst there are some middle aged people, most are quite old. 

Anyone of the citizens can identify the small settlement/hamlet as [[Prehevil]] .


### What do the citizens know
* Long ago, everything was peaceful, but some time 20 years ago something unknown happened, seemingly cursing everyone. 
	* No one can leave the town and forest anymore, attempting to leave will always result in them walking into a fog that heads back to town.
	* Noone was able to get pregnant anymore, even thought the towns doctor didn't see anything bad when doing research on both men and women. 
* In the beginning people who entered the forest didn't return, but slowly the town figured out rules to follow inside the forest to be able to traverse safely. The NPC can name these rules but is only willing to do it once because he's busy. The rules can be found at [[Prehevil's forest rules]].
* The town is currently at around 1/4ths capacity of what it once was. 
* Sometimes the town is attacked from horrid monsters from the forest, sometimes they look almost humanoid. 
* When the town was more populous, expeditions were held to find the source of the happening. Whilst everyone suspects the alchemists tower to have something to do with it, no-one has been to to tower and returned to talk about it.

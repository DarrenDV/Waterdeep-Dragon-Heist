[[The Saving of Stickey Mickey]] is a side quest with the goal of retrieving some ingredients for a cure for [[Stickey Mickey]] 's current condition, being a full blown rat. The quest entails travelling to an old, seemingly abandoned alchemist's tower, finding the ingredients in said tower and bringing them back to the lady of plagues in waterdeep to create a cure. 

# Arriving at the settlement

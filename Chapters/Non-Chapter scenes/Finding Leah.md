Linda is a frail, middle-aged woman who lives on the outskirts of town in a modest cottage near the edge of the Prehevil Forest. When the party approaches her, they find her sitting on her porch, gazing mournfully towards the forest.

Upon speaking to Linda, she explains that her daughter Leah was abducted while tending to the garden near the edge of the Prehevil Forests. She claims to hear her daughter's voice calling out to her every night, faint whispers in the wind. Linda is deeply troubled by these eerie nightly occurrences and pleads with the adventurers to find her daughter and bring her back. 

Whilst she doesn't dare step into the woods herself, she does say that heading into the woods from the gardens border is probably the best point of entry, seeing as to how she got snatched from there.




# The garden 
When entering the garden you see an ordinary looking garden, with some vegetables being grown and some flowers around the outer edge of the garden, bordering the woods.
At this border, there is 1 gap with no flowers, the player can either assume that Leah was gardening there or by asking Linda they can obtain the same info. 

By doing a perception, nature or survival check, the party can find a withering flower closer to the border of the forest. After noticing this one, the party can spot another one a few feet further, going into the forest.
They found a trail. 





# Entering the forest
Upon entering the forest the party can continue following the trail of withering flowers. After some time they the fog slowly starts to build up around them and sounds of moving bushes and branches can be heard. They're being ambushed by 4 twig blights, 3 needle blights, 2 vine blight and a rutterkin.

The creatures carry nothing.

After the battle is over the party can faint moaning, croaking and groaning coming from further up where the flowers lead.


The PC's can walk back to town to rest or whatever and they will have cleared out this portion. They can also walk further encountering Leah






# Encountering Leah
The PC's walk toward an open cleaning where in the middle of the clearing stands a lonely tree, the groaning now louder can definitely be perceived as a girls one and the party can faintly hear "Help me mother." coming from the tree. 

When coming up to the tree, the moaning suddenly turns into loud screaming and Leah jumps down from the tree towards the nearest PC. She is going to attack

Upon defeating Leah, the players can find an old pendants around her neck, showing a picture of her as a child with her parents. Around one of her "hands" is also a small ring, which can be picked up and identified as [[Nature's Thorn]] .

The players can bring this pendant back to Linda who'll weep upon seeing it.


Whilst she doesn't have much, she can spare 2 healing potions as a reward.

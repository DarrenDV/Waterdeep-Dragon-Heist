# Blood In the streets

When the party first goes toward the dock ward, they come upon the aftermath of a bloody clash between the [[Xanathar Guild]] and the [[Zhentarim]]:

"As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been blocked off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a 6 corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. "Get on," he says. "Nothing to see here.""

The skirmish represenents an escalation in the conflict between the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Xanathar Guild]].

The 3 captured are [[Zhentarim]] agents. 

The players can see a black tattoo of a flying snake on these arrestees

The guards will not let anyone near them. 




# Searching the dock ward

"Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and excrement linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings."

Roll perception

If high enough reveal Xoblob

"One nearby shop stands out from the others. It has a deep purple look, and in its window hangs a stuffed monster. Above the door hangs a sign which says "Old Xoblob Shop.""

If the characters want to, they can check out [[Old Xoblob Shop]] 


If they skip or after Xoblox shop go to The skewered dragon 





# The skewered dragon 

When approached:

"The Skewered Dragon looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship's anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards."

Act as if it's a tough bar

To get the required info, the drunkards should ask for a bribe. A good enough charisma roll is also sufficient. 


### What happened?

People remeber having seen Volo and [[Floon]] drinking together. [[Floon]] stuck around long enough after Volo left to meet with another friend. 
That was [[Renaer Neverember]].
"Just another spoiled, rich noble who likes to rub our noses in it!"

The two drank and played some games before leaving around at midnight. Five men followed them out.
Nobody has returned since. 

These men are known to frequent a warehouse on Candle Lane
"Look for a snake symbol on the door"

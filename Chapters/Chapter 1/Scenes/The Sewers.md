When PC's enter the sewers they find it's really dark, they require darkvision or some source of light to see.

The pc's only have one way to go.

Players arrive from the east tunnel

Show enough map to show entrance to Q12

Investigation check can reveal slits in the walls from Q2

If the party makes too much noise, the goblins in Q2 wake up.

```

Each goblin holds a pouch with 6 gold

If the PC's are loud enough enemies in Q5 will hear


## Q5
Before entering Q5, the pc's listen through the door if they were stealthy enough 

A duergar is attempting to block access to Q6 off with a bunch of random items found in the room.

If [[Krentz]] is alive, he is also in this room. Attempting to tell the duergar that his method's won't be sufficient. 
[[Krentz]] is able to recognize the party from the tavern if they intervened. 
If deceived or similar, they'll attempt to keep the party at bay because the interrogations in Q7 cannot be disturbed.

Duergar will fight to the death, [[Krentz]] will attempt to surrender if possible after that

Neither are carrying anything of value.




## Q6

The players are able to see goblin bones floating inside of the ooze and what looks like a silver bar worth 50gp

## Q7

"Threadbare banners hang on the sides of both walls in a long hall, in the middle of which a muscular half-orc in dingy robes stands with his foot on the chest of a male human with wavy red-blond hair. Fire burns around the orc's clenched fist, and his victim cries and squirms helplessly beneath him. Seated on a raised platform to the south is a nightmarish figure wearing black robes. It has large white eyes and rubbery purple skin, with four tentacles encircling its inhuman mouth. It cradles and gently caresses what looks like a disembodied brain with feet."

These are the hideouts boss Grum'shar and Xanathar's advisor [[Nihiloor]]. 

When the pc's enter the room. [[Nihiloor]] spots them first, placing his intellect devourer on the ground and attempts to leave through the double door in the west wall. - Q11.
While he leaves an orb on his belt starts to resonate, ne notices and gives an intrigued look to it. Grabbing it a feint spot of light appears pointing towards [[Lucyus]]. He notices this and continues to flee. 

The pc's can see  that [[nihiloor]] is carrying a small stone that looks like an eye. If they follow him, they can see [[nihiloor]] use it to open a passage to Xanathars hideout.

## Q8
Q8 holds nothing but a perception check 10 or higher reveals a passage to Q9


## Q9
Before entering the room, the PC's must move a large stone using a strength check of DC 10 or higher
When entering Q9, the player finds a halfling family that is really shocked to see the PC's.
They genuinely had no idea about the passage 
The halflings introduce themselves as the peabodys.
They have nothing to offer but can let the players know when something suspicious happens if they want to.
They can also let the PC's use this hidden entrance if it's ever needed. 


## Q10 
Q10 holds nothing of value, maybe some matresses



## Q11
If PC waited too long after [[Nihiloor]] entered room, he is gone without a trace
Else they encounter a magical door with [[Nihiloor]] walking through and it closing behind him. 

Give following room description:
"In the middle of this otherwise empty room is a stone pillar carved with a small symbol: a perfect circle with ten  spokes radiating outward from its circumference. In the middle of this circle is a smaller circular indentation that bears a passing resemblance to a lidless eye."

If they have the eye looking stone for whatever reason, they can use it to open up a portal. 

The PC's also have access to the door going back into the sewers



## Q12
A small passage too small to fit through leads into what looks like a cellar. A pc that checks can see some wererats working with some boxes moving stuff around. 

If the PC's somehow are able to enter the room. They are stopped by Roscoe who is a shardshunner wererat.

He won't allow the PC to continue going forward but doesn't kill him outright, only when he has to. 

He has 27hp and is small. 

```statblock
monster: Wererat
```


If the PC defeats or passes Roscoe, they can go up into a hostel with mostly halfling clientele. 
None of these turn out to be useful or know anything but they are friendly towards the PC.

POSSIBLEEXTRASTUFF



After all of this happened, the PC's are prompted to go back to [[The Yawning portal - location]] and turn in their quest.

Go to [[The yawning portal - 2]]

When the PC's return they can find [[Volo]] sitting at the bar anxiously awaiting their return. 

When Volo sees [[Floon]] , he runs up to embrace him.

After the reuniting, Volo looks anxiously at the PC's and says:
"I confess that I have but few coins to spare. But never let it be said that Volo breaks a promise. Allow me to present something much more valuable." He holds out a scroll tube. ''The deed to a remarkable property here in Waterdeep! I've already set everything up to hand it over to someone else, and I believe you'll be the right fit."

The tube is a deed to [[Chapters/Chapter 2/Scenes/Trollskull Manor]]

The deed is legitimate

Volo, Floon and [[Renaer Neverember]] all express their gratitude and are feeling in debt to the PC's telling them they'll be able to do some favours for the party.

Floon can not really provide anything useful. 

Volo can act as a guide to waterdeep and basically knows where almost anything can be found. 

[[Renaer Neverember]] does know some people he can get the PC's in contact with, such as the Harpers or other influential people

When the PC's are done they'll be instructed to visit [[Chapters/Chapter 2/Scenes/Trollskull Manor]], located in [[Trollskull Alley]].

They also level up to level 2

# What now
When walking back towards [[Prehevil]] the woods seem more at peace. The strong smell of sulfur getting less strong and will surely dissipate completely over the next couple of days. Far out in the forest, rotting corpses of what used to be monstrosities lie still on the ground. There is peace.

Getting back to [[Prehevil]] , the remaining townpeople are confused, as nothing like this has happened over the last 20 years. They are skeptical at first but seeing that the party made it back and that no monsters are in sight, even without the mist. They can believe that the party actually managed to finish it. 

Just RP it out.


The villagers don't have much as a reward, as their resources were slowly dwindling over the last 20 years and they didn't exactly have a booming economy. But they can scrounge up around 425 gold for the party. They do however feel very much in debt and are extremely thankful. 




# Waterdeep
Returning back to waterdeep the party had a nice travel, with nothing special happening on their way back. 

Arriving in waterdeep. They find a flyers posted everywhere for a couple of thing. A couple days after leaving, the yearly drow circus [[Bregan D'aerthe]], known for their technological advancements and inventions, arrived in the port and are doing their events and shows for the following month. And just 2 days ago, the yearly traveling market appeared, housing items from around the forgotten realms.


When arriving at the stolen gem, they find that the Lady of plagues is there, waiting for them. 

She says that she had been waiting for quite some time and was beginning to think that they wouldn't come back. 

RP it out.

When it comes to saving stickey mickey. The lady of plagues brings out a vial from her coat. She snaps the blue teardrop like fruit from the plant and inserts it into the vial. Instantly the color turns from a dark green to a bright blue and purple smoke bellows from the top. She hands it to the closest pc and says. Let him drink this, it should do the trick. 

After stickey mickey drinks the potion, he liquidifies, slowly expanding and gaining more liquid, until he returns as stickey mickey.

### What do the citizens know
* Long ago, everything was peaceful, but some time 20 years ago something unknown happened, seemingly cursing everyone. 
	* No one can leave the town and forest anymore, attempting to leave will always result in them walking into a fog that heads back to town.
	* No one was able to get pregnant anymore, even thought the towns doctor didn't see anything bad when doing research on both men and women. 
* In the beginning people who entered the forest didn't return, but slowly the town figured out rules to follow inside the forest to be able to traverse safely. The NPC can name these rules but is only willing to do it once because he's busy. The rules can be found at [[Prehevil's forest rules]].
* The town is currently at around 1/4ths capacity of what it once was. 
* Sometimes the town is attacked from horrid monsters from the forest, sometimes they look almost humanoid. 
* When the town was more populous, expeditions were held to find the source of the happening. Whilst everyone suspects the alchemists tower to have something to do with it, no-one has been to to tower and returned to talk about it.


### What to do in the city
Aside from talking to some random people there isn't much to do inside of the city. If the party wants to leave they find themselves lost in the mist, only allowing them to return to Prehevil after surviving an encounter.

In the middle of the town square there is a notice board, and whilst it isn't really updated frequently, PC's can find 2 papers that stick out:

* Missing person, dated around 6 months ago. Shows an image of a relatively young girl / woman named Leah. It reads: "Leah went missing 4 nights ago. She was tending the garden around 7pm and managed to only produce a yelp before being dragged into the forest. She was the youngest left in town. Mother claims she can hear Leah call to her every night. For more info, talk to Linda." [[Finding Leah]] 
* Bounty, "The Bell". No additional info on what the bell is is given. "Reward: A safer village, some gold." On the bottom it reads "Vulnerabilities unknown, no one saw it and lived to tell the tale." [[Defeating the bell]]

After a long journey through the forest the party stumbles upon the giant alchemist's tower looming over them. Next to this large tower is a small shed, with an open door. 

The shed provides a safe place for the party to do rests, at least for as long as they have not angered the towers inhabitants. 


### The tower 
The tower, whilst slim at the bottom, stands tall above the party for at least a couple 100 feet (270 feet total). The top portion of the tower is extruded to create space for rooms, whilst the bottom is largely used for storage and rounded stairs to the top. 

The front door of the tower is open. 

Looking at the top of the tower. The party can see thick mist flowing out of the windows.



### Entering the tower
Upon entering the tower the door slowly creaks closed behind the party, removing the natural light from the room. In this darkness, the only source of light for the party are small candles that bring dim light into the room. The entire floor is filled with random bags, crates, empty vials and cobwebs. Starting from the left of the room, a round staircase climbs up all the way above. Since entering the tower, a strong smell of sulfur surrounds you. 

The party can look around, let them RP. 

They can search the lower floor for a total of 3 healing potions with a good dice roll.


Each step up the stairs produces a loud creak which echos throughout the entire space. From time to time, a small creak can be heard from a floor upstairs. 



Almost at the top of the stairs, the stairs end. The party finds themselves in front of a door. The door does not have a peep- or keyhole but small flickers of light can be seen coming from underneath. Through these flickers of light, a large amount of mist can be seen pouring out. The area in front of the door, is decorated with a large rug showing a flowery pattern. 

Upon attempting to open the door, the rug will awaken, revealing itself to be an animated rug of smothering. It will grab every NPC who currently is on it and will attempt to throw them down the stairs. It has a surprise round.

### The alchemist's abode
When going through the door the players find themselves in a well furnished, alchemists towers. They are standing at the entrance of what looks like an entryhall to an alchemists abode. Next to them is a wooden coat hanger and a shoe mat for removing dirt. Whilst everything is relatively clean. There barely is any visibility due to the fog, now becoming very dense. 

The floor contains a living room, library, dining room and kitchen.

The corridor they are standing in leads toward multiple ways. In front of them the hall continues further, until reaching stairs that go to a floor above. 


##### Living room
To their left, they find what looks like a living room, suited with a fireplace, couches, a table, etc. Some empty mugs can be seen on the coffee table, one of the mugs still has some fluid in it, but it has gone gold. A stack of magazines can be seen lying on another portion of the table. Whilst the magazines themselves aren't really important. A PC can check and see the following titles in the stack:
* The Alchemist Adept
* Transmutation Times
* The Alchemy archive
* Mystical potions quarterly
There are some drawn pictures on the wall depicting a young brown haired human male. He wears rounded glasses and in some pictures has a satchel with some plants on his side.

##### Library 
The library has a bunch of bookcases going all the way up to the walls. In the middle of the room is a desk with a luxurious chair. Further in the back is a small display case, containing some books. 
In the back of the room a PC with a high enough perception check can deduce that the floor in the 2 back corners has a hidden compartment in them. They cannot be opened however as they are mechanically shut. 
Inspecting the bookcases reveals titles such as:
* "The Codex of Elemental Transmutation" by Master Alaric Stormbringer
* "The Secrets of Philosophers' Stones" by Hierophant Morgar the Wise
* "The Alchemical Encyclopedia of Mystical Plants" by Herbalist Rowan Greenleaf
* "The Art of Alchemical Artifacts" by Master Artificer Cedric Silverthread
* "The Complete Guide to Homunculus Creation" by Professor Cadwell Ironheart
* "The Enigmatic Elixirs of Elara Starweaver" by Luminary Elara Starweaver

Upon inspecting the display case the player can find the following books:
* "The Codex of Forbidden Transmutations" by Sorceress Morganna Bloodthorn
* "The Alchemical Rites of Lycanthropy" by Occultist Lucius Nightstalker
* "The Profane Elixirs of the Underworld" by Cultist Kaela Darkthorn
* "The Alchemical Key to Necromancy" by Lichlord Mortimer Dreadmoor
* "Malevolent Elixirs and Cursed Crucibles" by Black Adept Thorne Obsidian
Attempting to open the display case causes a small alarm to ring. The 2 corners of the room open up, lifting 2 sets of armor up. For a second, the armors do nothing. Until they can be seen sucking in a large amount of the fog. Turning them into animated armors. They are attacking.

```statblock
monster: Animated Armor
```
They have nothing.



##### Dining room
The dining room contains a large table with some porcelain and cutlery on display. There isn't any food present.


##### Kitchen 
The kitchen has large amount of storage cabinets all containing some general cooking ingredients. Wheat, potato's, bottle's of ale and most of the basics are present. The only thing that would normally be present but isn't is meat. 
Between the ales, some bottles of fine wine can be found. Elven Moonlight Vintage.


### 2nd floor 
The 2nd floor of the towers abode has some facilities that normally would be less accessible for non-visitors. These being, a bedroom, bathroom, greenroom and a storage room. At the other side of the floor, another set of stairs is present heading upward.

##### Bedroom 
The bedroom is a pristine place, not showing a single spec of dust visible through the thick fog. In the middle back of the room is a large queen size bed with two nightstands on either side. One having a glass of water next to it. On on side of the room a small walk-in closet is present containing some robes and general clothing. The other side of the room has a small desk containing some drawers with a locked book on it. The key is missing. A perception check with the drawers shows a hidden compartment with the corresponding key in it. Else they can try to bruteforce it. 

Once opened, the book is revealed to be the diary, showing the name Le'garde Blanchard. The book is filled with pages full of stories. But some pages nearing the end start to get your attention. 


	September 23rd 1454
	After a long trip I just got back from the 1454 Arcane Alchemy Summit and it was a wonderful experience. I managed to talk to my peers and collagues and even managed to have a quick conversation with Morgar the Wise himself! It was a dream come true and whilst he doesn't know who I am now, I'm sure he will next year!
	I managed to learn a lot and got a lot of souvenirs. I got some extremely rare seeds, a lot of literature and some new equipment for the lab. I also got approached by an alchemist outside the event who wanted to quit the profession after being mocked by the peers, he wanted to offload all his stuff and I got quite a lot of it for an extemely good price. Most of it is junk but still, it'll make some nice decoration.

	September 27th 1454
	Today I wanted to do some light reading, and after completing "The Art of Alchemical Artifacts" by Master Artificer Cedric Silverthread I wasn't really in the mood for another heavy book. So I decided to read one of the junk books I had, "The Alchemical Rites of Lycanthropy" by Occultist Lucius Nightstalker. No I know this is frowned upon and occultist alchemy is disallowed but I though it was a joke book. After reading it I have to say that I was wrong, this is quite interesting. 

	November 4th 1454
	In the last couple of weeks I have been buying some more of these occultist books and I have to say that I'm confused. I'm confused as to why we haven't researched this more. I have tried some small experients here and there and haven't done any harm. I believe that if I continue my research in this I will achieve a breakthrough in this field. I will open up the way for more research and we will achieve a new era for alchemy. 

	December 13th 1454
	I managed to snag myself a new copy of both "Maleficent Metamorphoses: A Guide to Dark Transformation" by Hexmaster Malachi Vipershadow and "Diabolical Alchemy: Conjuring Demons and Dark Transmutations" by Warlock Azrael Nocturne. And whilst I didn't believe it at first, I managed to perform a small ritual using some generic herbs healing a wounded animal from the forest. Nothing dark about it! A lot of the experiments written about here are however not about healing, they're about power and gaining knowlege. I've never seen a concoction doing something non-phyisical like that. It might be worth looking into that. 

	January 1st 1455
	Whilst I wasn't planning on it, after having too much drinks at new years last night I decided to do a small summoning ritual. I got in contact with an other planar voice who comes from a realm containing plants I've never seen before! I gave him some plants in trade for some of his. I'm excited to see what they can achieve. They are instantly different! They produce this strong sulferic smell, I had no clue plants could smell like that!

	January 4th 1455
	Something about those plants! I can think so clearly now. I cultivated them using  a recipe I got from the voice, a potion for the mind. Drinking it was like seeing the light, I can do so much more with this.

	January 20th 1455
	I have made a new ally and with it have seen the light. The true purpose for me is to continue my research further to ascend my profession. Chimer, as I call the voice due to the chime his bell produces, told me about a recipe I could do with some people. I got a friend from the village and after blowing some powder on him got complete control over him. After some time he woke up and didn't know what happened. It felt exilerating! I tried explaining it but he didn't understand, he's too stupid.

	February 7th 1455
	Chimer and I have agreed to open up a portal between our realms to increase the efficiency of our collaboration. I didn't know how smart he was, he has shown me the way of alchemy. The only annoying part is that fog leaks through the portal, but apparantly he needs it to survive, so I'll accept it. If he ever does act funny however, I can close the portal by closing the valves.

	April 30th 1455
	The forest is ours. The village is ours. I have become all powerful. All knowing. I have become a new god. My research shall continue. The Swords coast shall be next. I am Kaiser.

##### Bathroom 
The bathroom contains a bucket and some water pipes for defecating and showering. Nothing special.


##### Greenroom 
The greenroom is a warm room with a large amount of flower beds. All types of flowers can be found in the room from roses to tulips and some rare flowers of the forest.
A player with good nature check can recognize some rare flowers and attempt to harvest them
* Starshade Bloom (20gp)
* Aetherial Aconite (40gp)
* Phoenix ember Lily (50gp) burns upon bad roll
* Lunaria's blossom (35gp)
* Wraithbloom (25gp)

Along with these flowers, one special flower can be recognized by everyone. A drooped down black flower with dark gray lines coming from the center, in the middle protruding a small gray strand with a blue fruit like orb on it. **Abyssal Tear Iris**, the ingredient the lady of plagues sent you to find.

##### Storage room
The storage room contains a lot of alchemical equipment. In total 3 healing potions. 



### Top Floor
When walking to the top of the alchemist's tower, the players find themselves in a small hall in front of a door. Coming from behind the door a gentle buzz can be heard together with an occasional crank of a machine of some sort. Lightly beneath it all, a sound best describes as pipe spouting steam can be heard.

##### The Lab
Upon entering the room, the first thing noticeable is the extremely thick fog, really limiting eyesight. The sounds previously heard can be heard clearly now. The sulfuric smell is as strong as can be here. And from the other side of the room, a green and purpleish glow emits.

Natural light shines around in the room from windows, however dimly as the windows have netting on them to keep out bugs and pests from outside. 

You can see dim shapes around the room and can presume that the room is filled with desks and workbenches containing alchemical ingredients and equipment. 

Whilst looking around in the room you hear faint footsteps wandering through it, followed by liquids being poured and small poofs as the liquids react. 

You hear a voice coming from further in the room, but unable to see the producer of it due to the thick mist. 
"Some new visitors. Whilst I normally would enjoy keeping company I am busy. Leave."

This voice is [[Kaiser]] 

Any attempts to walk toward the voice or interfere in whatever he's doing will be met by aggression. Combat starts with him and 2 mephits

```statblock
monster: Steam Mephit
```

The voice has the following information. He talks few words per sentence. He talks egocentric and narcistic.
* The portal leads to a land of wonders, you wouldn't survive there as you are mere ants compared to that lands inhabitants. 
* The sulfuric acid smells amazing
* He wanted to help the people, but in becoming greater he discovered they are all maggots compared to him.
* They are not worth saving. 
* The chimer is the only friend he needs. 
* The chimer is in the forest doing his work whilst I do mine.
* Sacrifices should be made, and in my scheme, they are small and worthless. 

RP it out.

When walking closer the party can see the portal.

"From pipes on the floor and on the ceiling, you see multiple gases flowing, forming a portal emitting green and purpleish hues. The pipes are connected to 2 large cauldrons, one on each side. At the base of these cauldrons, where the pipes originate from. There are wheels that can be turned."


In combat Kaiser will try to use all the tables around for maximum cover. 
The Party can disable his portal. This firstly removes the the lair action to summon more. But also weakens him as there is slowly but surely less mist in the room. 

Some time after turning off the valves. A large amount of wailing can be heard coming from the forest. Looking at the forest, you can see that the mist is dissipating quickly. If the bell hasn't been slain beforehand, he dies with his body being unable to be found. 


When Kaiser is slain, an obsidian stone, embedded in his body ejects itself. This is the [[Shard of Xeluan]] . 


Looking around the room. You find a desk with multiple open books. 2 of these books stand out to you: "Maleficent Metamorphoses: A Guide to Dark Transformation" by Hexmaster Malachi Vipershadow and "Diabolical Alchemy: Conjuring Demons and Dark Transmutations" by Warlock Azrael Nocturne. A PC can recognize that these are the books used by Kaiser for his work the past few years and probably have a high value to them. 

During the fight, most of the equipment in the room has been destroyed, either by kaiser, the mephits or the party. There isn't anything worth salvaging.

### Visual

As you approach the temple, you are struck by its majestic presence. The temple is built into the rugged cliffs of the mountain, seamlessly blending with the natural surroundings. The stone walls are a mixture of gray and earthy tones, masterfully crafted to harmonize with the mountain's rocky facade.

A wide stone staircase, flanked by intricately carved stone lanterns, leads up to the temple's main entrance. The staircase winds its way through lush terraced gardens, where monks often meditate among vibrant bonsai trees and colorful flowers. Cascading waterfalls and serene koi ponds add to the sense of tranquility.

**Main Hall:**

Stepping through the temple's massive wooden doors, you find yourself in the main hall, a vast and open space that exudes an aura of serenity. Sunlight filters through the large, arched windows, casting warm rays onto the polished wooden floors. The walls are adorned with tapestries and calligraphy that tell the history of the Fists of Justice.

In the center of the hall is a colossal statue of a serene monk in a meditative posture, symbolizing inner peace and wisdom. Incense wafts through the air, creating an intoxicating atmosphere that soothes the senses.

**Training Grounds:**

The temple offers a variety of training areas, including open courtyards and stone-paved terraces with panoramic views of Waterdeep below. Monks can be seen practicing their martial arts forms, their movements flowing like poetry in motion. Training dummies and wooden targets are scattered throughout the grounds, providing ample space for honing combat skills.


**Living Quarters:**

Monks reside in simple, yet comfortable, quarters within the temple complex. Small, spartan rooms are adorned with traditional tatami mats, low wooden tables, and sliding paper screens that separate individual sleeping spaces. The rooms offer beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and forests.

### Astral wing
**The Astral Sanctum**

Tucked away within the Temple of Tranquil Heights, the Astral Sanctum is a sacred space designed specifically for Astral Self Monks. It serves as both a training ground and a place of profound spiritual connection. As you step into this special chamber, you are enveloped in an aura of mysticism and tranquility.

**Astral Artistry:**

The walls of the Astral Sanctum are adorned with intricate murals that depict the Astral Plane, where the monks' inner selves project their power. The murals come to life under the soft glow of ambient, magical lighting, with vibrant colors and ethereal imagery that mirrors the connection between the physical and the astral.

**Astral Targets:**

Throughout the Sanctum, there are floating, semi-transparent orbs and targets suspended in the air. These are used for target practice, allowing Astral Self Monks to hone their abilities and test the precision of their astral projections. Monks often practice their martial techniques, striking the targets with ethereal fists and projectiles that seem to materialize out of thin air.

**Meditation Stations:**

In corners of the Sanctum, there are raised platforms adorned with comfortable cushions and low wooden tables. These are meditation stations where monks gather to attune their minds to the Astral Plane. The serene environment, combined with the Astral Artistry and ambient lighting, fosters a sense of deep meditation and spiritual connection.

**Astral Mirrors:**

Astral Self Monks have access to mirrors designed to help them refine their astral projections. These mirrors are crafted from enchanted crystal, and when gazed into, they allow the monk to observe and control their astral form. Monks can use these mirrors to make fine adjustments to their astral manifestations and improve their combat abilities.

**Astral Presence Sculptures:**

Small sculptures and figurines depicting astral manifestations are placed throughout the sanctum. These sculptures serve as both decorations and training aids, helping monks to visualize and understand their own astral projections more clearly.

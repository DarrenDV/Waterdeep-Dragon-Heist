**Kazul Ardentmind** tells the player that if they want to visit marcellus, they can simply go to the subtemple of the astral self monks. It would be appreciated however if they could take some stuff with them to the temple.

If they say yes they are handed a bag containing 250 gold, some food, some monk clothing and some drinks from the drunken brawler monks. 

They can go to the temple at any time

# Arriving at the temple

The Astral Self Monk subtemple is a place of tranquility and beauty, nestled in the heart of Waterdeep's Southern Ward. It stands as a testament to the monk's connection to the astral plane, with a design that reflects the duality of physical and spiritual existence.

- **Architectural Style:** The subtemple is constructed from white marble, which gleams under the sunlight, making the building appear ethereal and otherworldly. The architecture combines traditional Waterdhavian design with eastern influences, featuring graceful curved roofs and ornate eaves.
    
- **Garden of Cherry Blossoms:** The subtemple is surrounded by a meticulously maintained garden filled with cherry blossom trees. In the spring, these trees burst into bloom with delicate pink and white petals, creating a breathtaking spectacle. The aroma of blossoms and the gentle rustling of leaves contribute to the overall serenity of the place.
    
- **Stone Lanterns:** The garden is illuminated by stone lanterns, which cast a warm and inviting glow in the evening. The lanterns are adorned with mystical symbols and runes associated with astral projection, adding an air of mysticism.
    
- **Entrance Gate:** The entrance to the subtemple is marked by an ornate gate that bears the symbol of the Astral Self Monk order, a pair of hands in a meditative pose surrounded by astral tendrils. The gate is made of intricately designed ironwork.


When arriving at the temple, the door is wide open, which is not that usual for monks as open doors usually invite disturbances during their meditation. 




### Inside

Entering the temple the party finds themselves in the main hall. 
Potted plants and vases can be seen scattered over the floor. Decorations on the walls have been torn. Small spatters of blood can be seen scattered everywhere. A fight occurred. There are a multitude of rooms connected to the main entryway. 

To the north, a small bedroom / office exists. A [[Zhentarim]] thug is searching chests, under the bed and drawers for anything he can find. 
To the east, a library room can be found. Containing 2 zhentarim thugs and an apprentice wizard.
To the south, a shrine room is present where monks can meditate. 


##### Bedroom
_The normally private and tranquil bedroom and office space has been forcefully intruded upon by a Zhentarim thug, who is now hastily searching for something. The atmosphere is charged with a sense of violation and impending conflict._

- **Open Drawers:** Drawers from the wooden desk and nearby cabinets have been pulled open and left ajar. Papers and documents are strewn across the desktop and floor.
- **Scattered Papers:** Documents, notes, and scrolls are scattered across the room, some crumpled and discarded in frustration. Loose papers are caught in the breeze coming through an open window.
- **Overturned Chair:** A wooden chair has been overturned, lying on its side. Its cushion and backrest are disheveled and show signs of being hastily rifled through.
- **Disturbed Bed:** The neatly made bed has been rumpled, with bed linens and pillows thrown aside in search of hidden items. The scent of the room's incense has been replaced by the acrid odor of intrusion.
- **Shattered Glass:** If there was a window, it might have been shattered or broken to allow entry or exit. Shards of glass may be scattered on the floor.

RP whatever they find



##### Library

Before entering the library you can hear some yelling coming from the other side of the door: "There has got to be something in here. Something useful. Else we're still reliant on that old fart."

_The library, once an oasis of knowledge and tranquility, now lies in disarray after having been ransacked. Books and scrolls are strewn about, and the room's peaceful ambiance has been disrupted._

- **Scattered Books:** Books of various sizes and colors have been carelessly pulled from the shelves and now litter the floor. Some pages may be torn or damaged.
- **Tumbled Bookshelves:** Several bookshelves have been tipped over, their contents spilling out onto the floor. Wooden shelves have splintered, and the books are in a haphazard pile.
- **Damaged Scrolls:** Scrolls have been unfurled and then carelessly left to curl and gather dust. Some have been stepped on or crumpled.
- **Ink Stains:** Inkwells have been overturned, leaving dark blotches on some of the books and scrolls. A musty smell of ink hangs in the air.
- **Desecrated Desks:** Wooden desks used for research have been disturbed, their papers and notes scattered. Ink quills and broken writing implements are strewn about.
- **Upturned Tables:** Study tables may have been flipped over in the chaos, chairs strewn haphazardly around the room.
- **Damaged Artwork:** If there were any art pieces in the library, they may have been damaged or defaced during the rummaging.

Inside of the room are 2 [[Zhentarim]] thugs and an apprentice wizard.

Looking at the thugs, the players can clearly see the [[Zhentarim]] sign, A snake with wings

Looking around for clues, the players can find some books scattered on the ground next to a flipped desk. The books titles seem weird as they only contain one word each.

- Monk
- Training
- Projection 
- Plane
- Astral
- Brawler 
- Traversal
- Enlightenment 

Each of the books contains blank pages and the only one of value is the book labeled "Astral"


Questioning the thugs after KO = RP



##### Shrine
_The once serene and sacred shrine room now bears the marks of violence and turmoil. The air is thick with tension, and the room's tranquility has been shattered. Splintered wood, scorch marks, and overturned furniture are testament to the recent conflict._

- **Damaged Altar:** The central focus of the room, the shrine or altar, has been desecrated during the fight. Offerings, candles, and incense have been scattered, and the altar itself is chipped and cracked.
- **Broken Statues:** Statues of revered monks, spirits, or deities that adorned the room have been knocked from their pedestals, their serene faces now marred by the violence. Some lay shattered on the floor.
- **Torn Tapestries:** Vibrant tapestries that once depicted scenes of harmony and enlightenment now hang askew or have been torn, their intricate designs disrupted by the struggle.
- **Extinguished Candles:** The candles that once illuminated the shrine room have been extinguished during the fight, leaving the room dimly lit and casting eerie shadows.
- **Dislodged Offerings:** Offerings of food, incense, and other symbolic items have been scattered across the room, contributing to the sense of chaos.    
- **Cracked Floor Tiles:** The floor tiles, typically pristine and well-maintained, now show cracks and scuff marks from the scuffle.

There are no people in the room 

Looking at the altar, you can see a small bookshelf containing a couple of books, there is space for one more book. The side-cover of the books in order reads: "A - Spiritual - Guide - Toward - The - .... - Self"

Finding the missing book "Astral" in the library here and placing it in the missing slot opens a secret room that leads into a backroom. 


##### Backroom
_The Astral Chamber is a hidden backroom within the Astral Self Monk subtemple, a sacred place where the essence of astral projection is harnessed and knowledge of immense significance is preserved._

**Visual Description:**

- **Astral Projection Pool:** In the heart of the chamber lies a circular pool filled with crystal-clear, tranquil water. The water reflects the surrounding murals and artwork, creating the illusion of a gateway to the Astral Plane. A soft, mystical glow emanates from beneath the pool, bathing the room in an ethereal radiance.
- **Bookshelves and Scroll Racks:** The chamber is lined with tall bookshelves and scroll racks. These hold ancient tomes, scrolls, and texts dedicated to the intricacies of astral projection, the history of the Astral Self Monks, and the monastery's spiritual practices. Some of the books are bound in rich, aged leather, while others are ancient scrolls adorned with mystical symbols.
- **Astral Mirrors:** Alongside the bookshelves are astral projection mirrors, which serve as both functional tools for monks to practice and refine their astral projections and beautiful decorative pieces. The mirrors are made of enchanted crystal and seem to shimmer with an otherworldly glow.
- **Incense Burners:** Incense burners in the chamber release a soft, soothing fragrance that lingers in the air, adding to the overall sense of serenity and spiritual connection.

The room looks pristine and the zhentarim havent been able to find it yet. 

Toward the side of the room they can find a desk with a notebook on it. Whilst most of it doesn't seem relevant, some entries are peculiar

	Today was an extraordinary day in the Astral Plane. As I went about my usual training and journeys, I encountered an intriguing and unfamiliar entity. He introduced himself as Mickey and was determined to explore the Astral Plane. Mickey and I struck up a conversation and shared our experiences. He has an undeniable passion for knowledge and adventure. It felt as though fate had brought us together, and I am curious about what the future holds.

	Time passes swiftly in the Astral Plane, and Mickey and I have become good friends. He has a genuine interest in the art of astral projection and has shared many of my experiences. I've revealed some of the secrets of this place to him, and he has proven himself a skilled and determined pupil. Together, we have overcome the perils of this world and aided others who were lost here.

	Mickey is becoming increasingly proficient in mastering his astral form and martial arts. I have taught him much about the power of the Astral Plane and how to use it to bring justice. His dedication and determination inspire me. As his mentor, I am proud of his progress and believe he will be a significant force for good, both here in the Astral Plane and on his own journey.

	I have been unable to go to the astral plane for quite some time unfortunatly due to work. I find myself immersed in the intricate affairs of the Astral Self Monks and the preservation of our sacred knowledge. The challenges we face in this realm are both formidable and ceaseless, and I am compelled to direct my energies toward maintaining the harmony and wisdom of our order. I do hope that mickey is doing fine. I'll try to visit him again as soon as I am able to. 

	I finally was able to go back to the astral plane after some months but was unable to find Mickey, I hope that he is alright. Whilst I am unable to go back to the astral plane as often as I usually would. I do hope that I'll find him again when I try again. 





After this they are done exploring the monk temple. They can return to **Kazul Ardentmind** to deliver the news about marcellus' kidnapping. Kazul will be shocked.... RP......

He will invite the players to help with the search and rescue efforts to find marcellus and see what the zhentarim are up to. 

"I hereby invite you to join the **Astral Lifesavers** as an attempt to find and rescue marcellus."

"Astral Lifesavers will be special monk acquaintances that are trusted here and can therefor access special monk only rooms, gain access to monestary assistance services and the works."

RP it out.

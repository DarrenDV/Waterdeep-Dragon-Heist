"Alright so we've heard reports that the zhentarim are looking to clear out an older scholars house. It apparently has quite some important books, but no-one really ever payed attention because the scholar was a bit off."

"Your task is to go to that house, grab every single book related to the echo dimension or about planar travel, and make sure the zhentarim don't get any."

"Because of the retrieval nature of this mission, you will be payed according to how good you perform, we'll pay you 90 dragons for every recovered book."

Corwin hands the party a piece of paper with the address and instructions. 

If you have any questions do let me know, otherwise I'll hopefully see you soon with some books.

# The house
You arrive at a street located somewhere deep in the north ward. Whilst the street isn't empty, there aren't many people around. Some garbage is littered on the street and the occasional cart travels past.

Arriving at the house you don't see any zhents around. Whilst the house has definitely seen better days, it doesn't look damaged or vandalized in any way. From inside you hear some faint classical music.


Knocking on the door the party is greeted by a crazy old man.
"HEEEH?! What are you whippersnappers doing at my home! I already bought cookies from the other scouts."

The man doesn't want to let the party in but can be persuaded into letting them in.


The man's books are located in the library on the ground floor. 
Inspecting the books around the library the party only manages to find 2.
"So Many Damn Planes by Maxwell Calt"
"Planar 101 by Nole Ksum"

The man doesn't want the party to just grab the books. He will mess with them using cantrips but can use fire bolt on them to hurt them if push comes to shove. 

Investigating the rest of the library reveals a trapdoor hidden beneath a carpet.

### Zhentarim approaching

After looting the basement some ruckus can be heard upstairs, if the old man is present with the party he'll go up to investigate. You'll hear some yelling before screaming occurs. If the old man is already dead the sound sounds like some things breaking and stuff being moved. These are 3 zhent thugs and 2 zhent apprenctice wizards and they will slowly make their way to the basement. 

The zhents can only know that they've started experiments on the echo dimension already and that their next objective is the hidden section of a library in the sea ward.

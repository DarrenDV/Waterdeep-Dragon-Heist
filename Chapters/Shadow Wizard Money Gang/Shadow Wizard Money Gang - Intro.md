After some time of Somed Music playing, a portal appears in the middle of the bar.

From the portal an orb of silence is being cast toward Somed, cancelling the sound of his music. 
Following that orb, a group of sentient instruments float out of the portal with a small music box following. Que medieval ganster.


4 hooded figures, followed by Corwin emerge from the portal and take seat at a nearby table. 

If siebren is present, let Corwin call to him, else Corwin will inquire where siebren is. 


### What has corwin to say
"Hey siebren it's been some time. These are my friend I was telling you about. My friends here are powerful wizards trying to keep the balance of knowledge in check. But they refer to themselves as The Shadow Wizard Money Gang....."

Rp it out.

"You remember that encounter with the Zhentarim we had a couple of week ago. Well they wanted something of yours. And if they even have a clue on what you have then that's bad. Those zhentarim want knowlegde for some reason and it's most likely not good. Say did you give them any info?"

No?

"Did they have a flying snake looking at you?"

Yes?

"Did it escape?"


Yes?


"Okay they know of you information. That means that my friends here need to know as well."


RP it out. 



"We need to take some action against those zhents, who knows what they're up to. And with at least a hint of your research, a lot of doors have been opened for them. I propose the following: You join us and we'll stop those zhents together."

Blue stone that opens portal to our hideout. 


Come visit when youre ready for work.

# Shadow wizard money gang hideout

Using the stone provided by the SWMG creates a blue portal in front of the user.

Going through the portal places the person in a small barely lit room with a door right in front of them. The air feels slightly damp and some noise can be heard from the other side of the door. 

Entering the door reveals a basement lounge of some sort, multiple couches surround a saloon table with a crystal ball on it, shelves of books and cabinets surround the outer walls.

Around a larger table Corwin and the 4 wizards can be seen discussing something. 

Upon entering the room for the first time the following sound is produced from a music box:

"
THOU ART LISTENING TO
*fireball explosion*
102.3
REAL WIZARDS FM
WHERE WE PLAYETH NOTHING BUT CHANTS, CHANTS, AND MORE CHANTS
"




The players is greeted by corwin who waves them to come sit at the table. 

When nearing the table, you can see that they're playing some kind of game with figurines and a lot of dice. 

"Yeah we're playing Drugs and Danceclubs. A pretty underground roleplaying game. I would've invited you to join but we're already in the middle of our campaign."

If inquired, their characters are:
* Jasper - Ranger
* Mika - Fighter
* Daniel - Monk
* Oliver - Bard
* Jelle - Wizard



So you're here for work I presume.

##### What the zhents doing.
So before we begin I think some knowledge should be shared so we're both on par.

What we know:
* The zhentarim are a mercenary company based in Kolat towers, their leader is a wizard hell bent on learning more powerful magic
* They're trying to tap into the "experimental" market, thus why you were probably asked to share your research 
* A flying snake spied on that encounter, presumably has shared what has seen and now they're heavily looking into your echo dimension. 
* Our employer has tasked us with making sure that nothing catastrophic will happen in the city and having two towers explode because of some cooked up wizard doing some weird experiments is the last thing we want. 
* Your goal will quite simply be to figure out their plan, make sure that they don't recover any echo dimension and recover those books, along with some others, yourself. Sounds easy right. 

So, you're up for some work?

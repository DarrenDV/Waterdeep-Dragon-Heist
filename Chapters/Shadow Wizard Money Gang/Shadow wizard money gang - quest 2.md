So the zhents are ramping up their aggresiveness regarding their echo dimension research. We think that due to no-one really stopping them for the last couple of weeks, they've made quite a lot of progress. 

They've started being a lot "in your face" about it and are now harrassing large public libraries for their restricted books sections.

We believe they're closing in on their goal so we'll need to start preparing to go on the offensive. We pondered into our orbs and saw they are going to attack the waterdeep grand library of the north ward next. During our pondering we also saw that to enter Kolat towers we'll need a special entrykey. Your mission: to infiltrate the north ward Grand Library of Waterdeep before the Zhentarim arrive, secure the restricted tome they seek, and capture their lead agent to gain access to their echo dimension research tower. Time is of the essence, and discretion is paramount.

Normal civilians will be inside the building, and they wont take kindly to us robbing the library. So keep your head down and don't let them catch you. Try to set some traps or ambushes so you'll have the upper hand if a fight does break out. You can use these 3 scrolls containing https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Glyph%20of%20Warding#content to help with setting traps. 

### Library
The players can explore the library for some time, but once they start attempting to solve the puzzle. Some lesser zhent mercs will enter the library. 

Whilst hiding / fighting the zhents the party will need to solve the puzzle to enter the restricted section.

###### Puzzle Mechanism

The magical door to the restricted section features a panel with the six symbols corresponding to the statues: Dragon, Eye, Hammer, Quill, Star, Sword. Players must press the symbols in the correct order to unlock the door.

###### Solution

The correct sequence is based on the hints given by the scrolls and the whispers, which correspond to the process of gaining knowledge or crafting a story: understanding languages, internal reflection or insight, building upon foundations, and then writing or recording knowledge.

1. **Dragon (Alzor the Wise)** - Understanding all tongues, the basis of magical knowledge.
2. **Eye (Thalia the Seer)** - Insight and true vision from within, necessary for wisdom.
3. **Hammer (Meren the Builder)** - Building knowledge from the ground up.
4. **Quill (Voren the Scribe)** - Recording and sharing knowledge completes the cycle of learning.




##### Easier version 
- **Alzor the Wise (Dragon):** "Magic begins with understanding languages."
- **Thalia the Seer (Eye):** "To see the truth, look within."
- **Meren the Builder (Hammer):** "Knowledge is built, piece by piece."
- **Voren the Scribe (Quill):** "Write what you learn for all."


1. **Alzor the Wise (Dragon):** "The essence of magic begins at understanding all tongues."
2. **Thalia the Seer (Eye):** "Look within to understand the essence of magic"
3. **Meren the Builder (Hammer):** "Knowledge is built, piece by piece."
4. **Voren the Scribe (Quill):** "Finally, share your knowledge by writing it down for others."

# Cassalanter villa

When walking towards the villa you can see that a increasingly thickening fog is enveloping not only the house, but the block surrounding it as well. Currently the fog isn't as thick as when you were in the forest.

Cedric can recognize the the features as some people from his old village, two elder gentlemen who were parents at some houses around him. They do recognize cedric as well but are somewhat hostile. As long as the party does not exercise caution around the gentlemen they'll attack. Accompanying the gentlemen are 3 cult followers who are trying to keep them calm. The cultists will not attack the party directly because they are too preoccupied with keeping the golems calm but will attack once combat starts.

##### C17 Playroom
The room is filled with giant stuffed dolls, toys and wooden rocking horses. The room is a mess, and everything is left as if nobody has had time to clean up. There is no-one else present. 

4 Fusions of people using zombie statblocks roam the upper floor. They're obviously people, but merged in such a way that they're not distinguishable as any individual anymore. They produce feint cries and seem focussed on cedric, almost as if they recognize him.

##### C18 Twins bedroom + Closets
Empty holding nothing of value
##### C19 Master Sitting Room
##### C20 Linen Closet
##### C21 Master Bedroom 
The walls are adorned with nine friezes, each one depicting a layer of the nine Hells. 
A four-poster bed draped in deep red curtains and tipped with gold spires stands before an ornate door carved from dark hardwood with a gold latch, the door is unlocked.

A search of the room reveals a golden lockbox tucked under the bed. Golden Lockbox. Both Victoro and Ammalia keep their cult regalia in a solid gold lockbox (worth 750 gp) hidden under their bed. The box can be unlocked with either Victoro's or Ammalia's golden key, or by a character who makes a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. It can also be pried open with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check.

##### C22 Private study

The room contains the following features: 
• The walls are lined with bookshelves packed with thick tomes. 
• A grimoire with a red leather cover sits on a desk carved from dark oak. 
• A ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. 

Book shelves. The books on the shelves include works of fiction and nonfiction. 

Desk. Aside from the grimoire (described below ), the desk holds an ornate golden candlestick (worth 50 gp), a golden inkwell (worth 25 gp), and a feathered quill pen (worth 15 gp ). The desk drawer contains a wax seal bearing the Cassalanter crest. 

Red Grimoire. The tome on the desk, bound in crimson leather, details a diabolical ritual that Ammalia and Victoro enacted to first contact the archdevil Asmodeus . Opening it reveals nothing but blank pages with a few drops of dry blood on them. If a drop of humanoid blood is spilled on any page, lnfernal text on that page becomes legible, remaining so until the book is closed. The blood remains even after the text vanishes.

Any character with the Ritual Casting feature (or the Ritual Caster feat) who spends 24 hours reading the book can master the ritual described within. The ritual takes 11 minutes to cast and requires incense and a vial of unholy water (which are consumed during the performance of the ritual). At the end of the ritual, a proxy of Asmodeus appears and grants its summoner the benefit of a commune spell. The proxy is formed of incense smoke and resembles a pit fiend. A character must finish a long rest before performing the ritual again. 

Trapdoor. The trapdoor in the ceiling is the entrance to the attic.
##### C23 
Attic Landing, simple wooden door is presented for the players, the door is unlocked and a small murmur of chanting can be heard coming from the other side. 

##### C24
Main Attic 
Inside of the attic 3 cult followers are chanting over an pentagram magically locking the temple door. The chanters are aware of the parties entrance into the room but keep chanting. If and when the ritual is disturbed, one Master of Cruelties and 3 dretches spawn, defending the ritual. When the 3 cult followers die, the pentagram dissapears and the door in the basement unlocks.

##### C25 Garden

##### C26 Cellar
The Cellar contains 2 doors, one leading toward the dungeon and the other leading towards the temple. The door leading towards the temple is magically shut by occult magic. The clerics with the party are unable to open the door by any means. The door is locked in place by the ritual being held in the attic.

##### C27 Wine Cellar
##### C28 Storage room
A feint magic can be felt coming from the southern wall. This leads towards the secret vault and entrance into the temple.
##### C29
Secret Vault
Contains 20 silver bars worth 25gp each and the stairs down to the temple. End session here with long rest bonus.














### Temple of asmodeus
When first walking down into the temple of asmodeus the party finds themselves in something that could only be described as a completely different complex. Walls are made of dark huge deep slate bricks, lined with candles producing very little light. Walls are 20 feet high with arches connecting the sides every 15 feet. The doorway down at the bottom of the stairs is around 10 feet tall, making the party look small in comparison. On top of all of this, a thick haze, presumably caused by the ritual, is limiting vision quite a bit. 

##### A1 Hall of the damned
You traverse down the stairs and come by a crossing, the middle of the crossing contains a set of spiral stairs going further down. Whilst a thick haze keeps blocking sightlines you can hear some sort of wailing coming from south of the crossing. The wailing sounds more akin to human sobs and cries than anything else. 
To the north of where you are located you can hear some feint footsteps going coming near you and going further out, constantly repeating itself. Whilst it is hard to point out, you can hear some sort of chants coming from both that direction and down the stairs. 
Going south leads to the prison A1a.
The stairs lead to A3
North leads to A2


###### A1-a Prison


##### A2 - Hallway and balcony
The hallway between the 



##### A3 - Anterior Vestibule
The set of spiral stairs down from A1 leads to this chamber. Mounted directly in front of the exit of the stairs is a large 18 foot high, 9 foot wide portrait in a gilded frame. The picture depicts a strikingly handsome and impeccably dressed bearded man with small horns protruding from his forehead. He carries a ruby-tipped cane. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the figure as Asmodeus.

The room is guarded by 2 bearded devils, who are unaware of who the party is due to the haze, but will attack on sight once the party gets close. 

On 2 opposite ends of the staircase are halls leading towards A7, the main ceremonial hall. 2 unlocked thick wooden doors with iron handles keep the room out of sight but chanting and mumbling can be heard from the room, together with the occasional screaming. 

The door to the right leads towards the cassalanter family crypt A4

Another hallway downwards towards the south leads to A5.

##### A4 - Family Crypt
The room you entered is pitch black, only lit by the light coming from the now recently opened doorway. Candles on the walls are long burnt out and the room is covered in dust and cobwebs. You can only have a small glimpse of what the room contains, that being a large amount of decorated stone coffins, before 3 specters and one ghost appear coming out of the walls. The specters are long distorted by time and resemble no discernable human. But the ghost still resembles his old self: a handsome, clean-shaven man of knightly bearing clad in plate armor with a small symbol of Tyr on it's chest. Upon seeing the radiant rainmaker in action, the ghost is able to snap to it's senses, halting it's attack and trying to reason with the specters. The specters wont listen and will continue their attack until they are defeated. 

When the specters are defeated, the ghost will show itself to the party and wave with it's hands to follow him. If the party decides to follow him, he leads them to his tomb and opens it for them. Above the tomb is a painting of the same handsome clean-shaven man, clutching a chalice, with the name "Caladorn Cassalanter" underneath it on a plaque. A history check can reveal that Caladorn was a former masked Lord and Hero of Waterdeep. 
Inside of his sarcophagus lies a skeleton with 2 items; a mace of disruption and +1 plate armor. Upon attempting to grab either one of the items Caladorn asks: "Do you vow to use these items to defeat the forces of darkness?" Upon which any positive reaction the ghost will dissipate, saying: "Use the mace to destroy the effigy of evil incarnate. End the corruption to restore my family's honor." The effigy is referring to the statue in A7. 

The rest of the crypt contains no items of value.

##### A5 Storage
Upon nearing A5 a foul stench can be smelled coming from the room. Approaching it the party is quickly able to discern why. A massive pile of bodies lies in the middle of the room, presumably used for rituals of some sort. What is noticeable however is that some of the bodies piled up in this room wear cult regalia, although very filthy. The sides of the room contain tables with chairs and crates stacked on top suggesting that this room had been repurposed for the storage of bodies.

Someone who is searching the room can find a indented wall, connecting to area A6.

##### A6 Secret Vestry
A6 is a small secretive room between A5 an A7. 

• Against the south wall stand two black wardrobes with nine-pointed stars carved into their doors. 
• A pair of tall, slender mirrors are mounted on the west wall, their stone frames carved with serpents. 
• Stacked in the middle of the room are six casks of wine used for cult celebrations. 
Each wardrobe contains five complete outfits of cult regalia sized for adult humans: red robes, devil masks, and wooden amulets shaped in the symbol of Asmodeus. 

In front of two mirrors you find 2 cult fanatics in the process of dressing themselves

##### A7
##### A8 Closet
A8 is a small storage closet containing gold and other ingredients used for rituals by the cult. A coffer containing 250gp can be found together with multiple vases of withered flowers and basket filled with different types of rocks.


##### A9 Stream and pool
An underground stream flows through the west side of the temple and into a 5-foot-deep pool here before meandering northwest and emerging in the Mud Flats.

After the succesfull heist against the circus of innovations the party go back to the stolen gem to celebrate their victory and seeing whats next now that they have all the eyes. 

Upon returning to the stolen gem they find that multiple large carriages are in the street next to their building, with a numerous amount of guards posted outside their bar. 

Asking one of the guards whats going on will prompt the guard to send the players inside of the bar.


## Meeting the mayor
The bar is filled with guards, with the barstaff sitting in one corner being questioned and Brok in another. In the middle of the room the players find Captain Staget talking to a woman dressed very sharply and nobely. She has long white hair braided almost into a crown around her head, she's wearing a long white gown with gold and red trimmings. She looks to be somewhere around 50 years old and has a serious look on her face that turns into a smile when she sees the players. The people from waterdeep recognize here instantly, she's Laeral Silverhand, the current Lord of waterdeep. 

Guards close the door behind the players and captain staget leaves her alone. She takes a few steps towards the players and introduces herself.

"Greetings, my name is Laeral Silverhand, I'm the Lord of waterdeep. I know this is a bit of an late introduction, seeing as to how much you've done in this city, my question just is.... why?" 
"You've dismanteled multiple factions in this city that were causing trouble, I didn't even know about the cult before you guys stopped them."

RP IT OUT A BIT

### The jist
Larael wants to know what the players are up to and possibly make a deal with them, turning the city in to an ally or enemy depending on what the players say.

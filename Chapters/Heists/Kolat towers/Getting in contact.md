The party decided they wanted to start with the zhentarim heist first

Brok goes to the party:

"Alright gang so you're gonna tackle the zhents first right? The thing that we're missing the most with the zhents is information, and storming kolat towers could be a death trap. Luckily my brother sindri has infiltrated their ranks. You're gonna pull him out by faking his death. I've managed to set up a contraband deal with the zhents which he will be joining, "

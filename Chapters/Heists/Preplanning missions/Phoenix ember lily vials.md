Brok tells the party that some lava vials could be useful for melting down locks and certain traps. He gives the hint that any local botanist will probably know where some of the phoenix ember lily flowers for these could be acquired.

Speaking to the local botanist she tells the party that whilst the flower is uncommon, it tends to grow in dimmer and moist locations underground. She recommends that checking out the sewers below the dock ward could probably prove useful for finding the flowers. 

After around an hour of searching the sewers the party can smell a spicy aroma coming from a tunnel further down. Coming around the corner where the aroma is coming from the party can also find a otyugh, muching away on a great pile of dung, making space around it's laid eggs. 

The party can try whatever.

```statblock
monster: Otyugh 
```

Getting past the otyugh will result in the party being able to retrieve 3 pheonix ember lilies

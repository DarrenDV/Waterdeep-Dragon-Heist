Whenever the party arrives at the harbor give them a description of what they can see.

"Arriving at the harbor you are greeted by a small gate with a drow guard stationed inside a small cubicle, keeping an eye on everyone who leaves and enters. The harbor seems to have changed into essentially a compound, with large piles of crates scattered around the place from what you can see. The entire compound has been surrounded by a large 8 foot high fence to keep people out of it.

"Towards the south (your right), you see 3 large boats docked next to one another. You see some drow shipworkers on the boats carrying varying crates and boxes on and off the ships. The only quick distinction you can see between the boats are the flags. The left boat has an flag with the depiction of a heart. The middle one has a depiction of flames. The right one that of a glistening eye."

"The people walking around the compound are definitely varying, some seem like normal dockworkers, and some are definitely the stereotypical pirate. The one thing they almost all have in common however are that they are of drow descent. Aside from the walking nimblewrights of course, but they are only a few of them walking around."

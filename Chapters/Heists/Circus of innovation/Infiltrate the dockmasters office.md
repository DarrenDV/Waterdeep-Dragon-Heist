"Alright guys you'll be going towards those circusfolk for the remaining eye. I'm sure you've seen it before but their fleet consists of 3 identical huge ships. To not waste time I think it's best to figure out which ship is their "main" ship." Brok says. 

"Due to the mere size of their guild and the area of the docks they closed off, they'll surely have some sort of dockmaster with an office containing ledgers and the like. I'd recommend finding this office and gathering whatever info you can on those ships before boarding."


## Finding the building

The dock that the circus of innovation closed of has essentially been turned into a large compound, much like they have every year. This compound has a large amount of construction yard office like boxes making finding the dockmasters one by pure luck quite hard. 

In order to get knowledge on the correct one the party can:
- Spy around and try to see something
- Find an lone drow and get the information out of him
- Search around on the street for information 
- Go to a local tavern frequented by the circusfolk and ask around or ask them directly.
	- Bribes, gamling, whetever and the like

If a competent drow gets a suspicion on the party he'll get a few drow and start to ask questions. Possibly even a skirmish. 

Whilst the drow are definitely in a criminal organization, some are truly honest dockworkers keeping their hands out of that part of the business, so not everyone knows about the party.

RP it out, let the party take the lead.




## Infiltrating the dockmasters office

The party found out the location of the dockmasters office and now they'll have to infiltrate the compound. 

The party arrives at the compound and is greeted by a guard post, fences around 2,5 metres high surround the entire compound.

The guard post is quite small, most likely 6x6 feet. Yet the guard keeps looking forward into space, not paying any attention to the party in the corner of his eyes. 


When attempting to pass the guards checkpoint he'll ask what they're doing there and ask for proof of entry. The party can attempt to RP this out. Failed RP will result in a possible minor skirmish or guards more on high notice. 


Once past the gate, the party needs to find their way towards the dockmasters office. It is situated almost dead centre in a large box filled corner of the docks. In and around this portion of the docks multiple drow can be seen walking around and talking to eachother. 


The party can decide their way to arrive at the office but being overly suspicious will alert some drow to investigate. 

Arriving at the office the party sees a small office, not larger than a common living room in size. Multiple windows with blinds halfway down surround the outer walls. The door to the building is a simple wooden door with a simple lock. No-one of higher ranking can be seen around and the office is empty. 

LET THE PARTY RP TO FIND A WAY INSIDE.




## Searching for information 

Once inside the office the players will need to spend some time trying to find the correct ledger with information. After some time the players find a ledger titled "The Ledger of Lost and Looted". Opening the book quickly shows information about which items are present on which of the 3 ships, with detailed names for each ship.


| Item Description                         | Ship             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Inflatable Clown Heads                   | The Heartbreaker |
| Clown Shoes (Assorted Sizes)             | The Heartbreaker |
| Trapeze Equipment                        | The Heartbreaker |
| Lion Tamerâ€™s Chair (Slightly Chewed)     | The Heartbreaker |
| Crates of Dried Fish                     | The Hellraiser   |
| Barrels of Mysterious Goo                | The Hellraiser   |
| 17 Empty Boxes (Why?)                    | The Hellraiser   |
| Nimblewright Parts (Left Legs Only)      | The Eyecatcher   |
| Sealed Crate: Gold Bars                  | The Eyecatcher   |
| Ornate Chest: Bejeweled Goblet           | The Eyecatcher   |
| Nimblewright Prototype (Spins Aimlessly) | The Eyecatcher   |
| Crate of Spell Components                | The Eyecatcher   |
| Unmarked Box: Rare Artifacts             | The Eyecatcher   |
| Sealed Chest: Jewelry Collection         | The Eyecatcher   |
| Nimblewright Repair Kit (Missing Tools)  | The Eyecatcher   |


## Confrontation
When having found what the party is searching for they'll encounter a higher ranking drow official outside of the building with 2 nimblewrights and some dockworkers. They'll be highly suspicious of the party and unless RP'd greatly initiate combat. If the party succeeds in RP, they might be able to extract more information for the upcoming heist.

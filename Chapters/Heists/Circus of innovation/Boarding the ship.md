### Arriving at the harbor

The harbor is still in full swing when going to the harbor, with a bunch of drow moving around inside of the compound. On the far right side of the compound the 3 tall ships of the circus of innovation can be seen. 


When the players want to go to the boats, they'll need to do it with minimal suspicion, otherwise they'll be halted and possibly fought by 2 nimblewrights and a drow gunslinger. The party can try to find a roleplay-ey solution to getting on the boat of their choosing. 




### The ships

Part 2 contains 3 locations which can be visited in any order, but the following order is recommended as the temple of rot gives the lead hint to part 3.

[[Rats - Part 2#Temple of rot]]




# Dock wards Apothecary
"You arrive at the address listed in the newspaper handout. You find yourself on Dark Lane in front of the apothecary. Above the door is a small sign that's hard to spot unless you're looking for it reading Dock ward's apothecary."

When walking into the room following:
"When entering the apothecary, you find yourself in a reception area.
- Walls are lined with small drawers, posters on health and shelves with dusty bottles and potion.
- In the middle of the room, you see an aquarium of leeches on a table with 2 couches on either end facing each other."
- And you see a reception desk, where a woman is reading a newspaper. Behind her you can see a curtained doorway. On the reception desk is a small sign reading "Joy Hult"."



Joy's goal is to drive characters away by saying stuff like:
- "Appointment books are full and they’re to come again another time. Or not. Whatever"
- If characters browse the shelves of snake oils and false potions and try to purchase anything, Joy pauses with an annoyed look and then says the items are floor samples. Not for sale.
- If characters ask about the curtained doorway, she simply states it isn’t their business.
- If characters force their way past her and through the curtain, she shrugs and halfheartedly insists they stop – “Oh… no… please… don’t…” – without looking up from her newspaper

Joy has the following character sheet and only will attack when the players find the secret laboratory.

monster: Spy

## The surgery
When the players walk behind the curtain they find an operating room. In the middle of the room is a wooden chair with tables of surgery equipment next to it. The chair has a lever in it's base, presumably for adjusting the backrest. The walls are littered with shelved containing jars of leeches and pickled organs. 

If a character pulls the lever, the chair tips over as a trapdoor opens underneath it, revealing a deep pit with an iron ladder is set into its walls. Anyone seated in the chair is dumped into the secret laboratory 20 feet below. They would get 2d6 falling damage.

When the lever is pulled, joy attacks. 



## The secret laboratory 
You land or climb the ladder down into what looks like a secret laboratory. A quick glance reveals steel tables filled with glass vials and masks, with sludge-colored liquids simmering over open flames. You see cages filled with rats that start screeching upon seeing you and further down the room, 8 robed figures wearing black robes, brimmed hats and beaked masks. 
Upon seeing you they instantly go for you with swords in hand. 
Roll initiative. 
```statblock 
monster: Cultist
```
The cultists carry 50gp in loose change. 

Interrogation. 
If the cultists are captured and questioned, they admit that:
- they work for the Lady of Plagues and reveal that they’re concocting a virus to turn the residents of Waterdeep into rats. 
- Characters who ask about the Rat King are told that the Lady of Plagues foolishly fell in love with the Rat King but was betrayed and has now sworn revenge on the city. 
- Their mistress is the only one with an antidote for the Rat Pox, but she has no intention of using it now. 
- She’s currently somewhere in the city above, preparing to unleash the plague.

Rats. 
Characters who examine the caged rats can make a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, they realize the rats appear diseased. At best, some are disoriented or feverish. At worst, they’re covered in pustules. Oddly, one of them has an oversized gold tooth. Its tooth is worth 5gp. 


Looking around the room you can find a desk in the corner of the room. The desk has multiple copies of advertisements much like the one in the newspaper copy you obtained. Next to it you find 2 cypher wheels. Give them both handouts. 
![[Apothecary ciphers.png]]
Puzzle answers:
• I WISH FOR THE DAY OUR LOVE IS NOT HIDDEN 
• SAW A RAT TODAY AND THOUGHT OF YOU 
• IT WASN’T ME WHY CANT YOU SEE IT
The original newspaper has the following cypher:
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU THIS IS WAR


The PC's are done at this point here. They can either follow the original rat tracks back to the [[Rats - Part 2#Temple of rot]] or visit [[Rats - Part 2#Harbor holdings]] 










# Harbor holdings
When walking up toward the address you found for harbor holding you spot it instantly. You see a bright pink building, almost as if it had a fresh splash of paint on it, in the middle of this dreary neighborhood. Above the large front door you see the HH symbol also visible in the newspaper. 

Entering the building, you once find yourself in a simple a simple reception area. The area is furnished with multiple potted plants and some sofas. An iron doorway is directly opposite the main entryway, guarded by 2 male gnomes who look exactly alike. You get greeted by an elderly gnome who's head barely gets over the counter.  

Her name is snixxy silverhearth and she is a typical nice old lady. 
The other gnomes and tense, quiet, and a bit on the shyer side. They'll do whatever it takes to protect business. 

"Hello dearies! What can I help you with? Do you wish to open an account or do you want to rent a lockbox?"
If the PC's give her the note the following happens:
	She grabs it and reads it as close to her face as possible - Snixxy greets one of them as Captain Brisby and notes “how many lovely friends” he’s brought with him today.

If they don't give her the note just RP or something IDK

When she read the note or the PC's convinced her somehow of letting them back.

Snixxy takes the characters into the back room, where she taps on Box 908 among the many that line the walls. Before she can open it, however, she informs the characters that they must solve some simple puzzles using “security hints.” With that, she hands a parchment to “Captain Brisby”. Give them the handout. ![[Harbor holdings Security check.png]]

Solving the Puzzle:
To solve the first part of the puzzle, the character must fill in the blanks by writing down three different ingredients: “Cheese”, “Crackers” and “Grapes”. 
In the second part, they must outline the word “Red” in the word search. 
In the final part, they must rearrange the letters to spell “Catarina”.



Failing to give a correct check results in the following:
Both twins declare the PCs frauds and attack, they are 2 thugs. 
```statblock
monster: Thug
```



Giving the filled out check back to Snixxy will result in the following.
Snixxy will open the lockbox using a key she has. 

Inside the lockbox is the following: 
- A 50gp pouch
- A toy rat, when picked up the pressure from their hand causes the rat to squeak, and a motherly voice within says "Mr. Squeaks loves you!"
- Some letters, give them handout

# Temple of rot
When following the tracks leading out of the apartment the players will be lead to the temple of rot.

"You follow the tracks coming out of the apartment and end up between multiple buildings in a large square. In the middle of the square you see a large statue made out of scrap and junk, depicting a person with a beak mask. The square is filled with sick people, some in the late stages of the infection, having large spots of fur, beady eyes and tails. Most of the sick are huddled around the large statue in the middle."

These people can be interacted with, they pose no threat and are neutral towards the PC's. 

They possess the following information:
• “The statue? That there’s the Lady of Plagues. Don’t know much ‘bout her ‘cept she’s the queen o’ death ‘n’ disease.” 
• “The Lady of Plagues is the only one who can lift this plague! She can save us!” 
• “She’s a real mystery woman. All I know is she arrived just before the first case of Rat Pox. They say she’s the only one with the cure, so… here I am.” 
• “Dock Ward is the Rat King’s turf. If you ask me, the Lady of Plagues unleashed Rat Pox to wipe out the King’s men.” 
• “The Rat King?! Don’t say that name here. We worship only the Lady of Plagues!” 
• “The Rat King and the Lady of Plagues hate each other, and the Dock Ward has suffered for it. So many fights. So much blood. As if we didn’t have it bad enough with the Xanathar prowling about!” 
• “Maybe the Rat King spread Rat Pox to frame the Lady of Plagues?!” “Please. Don’t be a conspiracy theorist.” 
• “I hear the priests of the dock ward have organized a prayer march. The Salvation Parade? This is a bad idea. We must only worship the Lady of Plagues!”


After some time of talking around with the characters, screams suddenly break out as rats overwhelm the temple. 
Shouts from the crowd exclaim they’ve angered the Rat King, and several worshipers move to protect the statue. 
During the stampede, the characters are attacked by 3-5 swarms of rats.

When the fight begins, a furry-eared halfling stumbles and falls to the floor, where he’s soon surrounded by angry rats. This is Wash Meadsocks, a halfling sewer worker. Through halfling luck, Wash survives the encounter even if he’s left to fend for himself.

```statblock
monster: Swarm of Rats
```


If the characters defeat the swarms, the remaining rats terrorizing the crowd flee toward a nearby sewer grate. 
Wash Meadsocks exclaims: “The sewers… That’s where the Rat King lives!” He provides the following information:
• The Rat King lives down there in the sewers. Wash thinks he knows where. He can show the characters if they want. 
• Wash advises that they don’t enter the sewers unless they’re completely ready to face the Rat King. That’s her home turf, you see. Yes, she’s a woman. Wash has seen her.

Wash can point the players toward the Rat King’s lair, but warns them against venturing down too hastily. 
If the characters head into the sewers, go to [[Rats - part 3]]

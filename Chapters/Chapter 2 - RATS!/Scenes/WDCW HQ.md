# Walking into WDCHQ

The players walk into WDCW HQ, describe what they see as follows:

"From outside, the building looks like an enlarged barracks. However upon entering you see a building decorated to look like a large office space."

"You enter what looks like a small tavern, in front of you is a small counter with some people writing in paper with some kegs of booze behind them, to your right some city watch drinking and chatting happily with eachother. Behind them you see an opening that leads to what looks like normal barracks, a sign above the opening reads City watch"
"To your left you can see an opening with a bunch of noise coming from it, above the door hangs a sign reading [[Force Gray]]. When looking into the opening you see a bunch of people all running around looking stressed; papers are flying, people are arguing and nobody looks like they have a good time." 


## Possible main interactions
When attempting to speak to the guards, the critical info they know is as follows:
* Higher-ups made it the problem of force gray so they dont care
* They're on their break
* They're not permitted to talk confidential stuff

When wanting to walk to either side before talking to the receptionist:
* Players will be told by a guard to stop and not enter without permission
* Anyone who's entering regardless will be arrested for hampering justice / resisting arrest



When players want to talk to the receptionist, she'll greet them:
"Hello there, I'm sorry but were all quite busy with some important matter, so if you could please vacate the premises that would be appreciated."
When told that captain staget had invited the party, she'll act surprised and say something along the lines of "OH! You're the guys he was talking about about (suprised), I had imagined something else."
She'll wave at a guard to lead you to captain staget's office.



# Meeting captain [[Staget]] 
## On the way
On the way to captain staget players can spot a bunch of groups split off in [[Force Gray]], A waterdavian PC can spot the difference on a high enough history check. The departments spottable are: Public relations, Current issues, Crisis team, Research & Development, The scouts and special operatives.

The players will be guided towards stagets office and any unsuccesful attempt to steer off-path will be a possible cause for arrest in the eyes of the escorting guard. 

At the end the players will arrive at the office of staget, a private office at the far back of the department.


## Stagets office 
When PC's enter the office, they'll encounter staget with his back turned to the party, loudly monologuing to himself:

"The sky was grey and grim in Waterdeep that
day. Grey as the faces of those poor souls
stuck behind the quarantine barricade down
the docks. Grim as them too. The mystery of
the Rat Pox. Docks Disease. Pest Plague.
This case had a lot of nicknames. About the
only thing it had more of was dead ends.

We were about to give up when they walked
in the door like a bright-eyed town hero
walks into a tavern - armor gleaming like
it’s fresh off the rack with the tags still
on. I didn’t know who they were, but they
looked like trouble..."


Staget greets the PC's and thanks them for coming at such short notice. He takes the PC's under oath that this is confidential information and if word should get out, they'll be the first to get eyes on them.

What does staget know:
* A mysterious disease is rampaging through the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, forcing the city to quarantine the entire district. The disease, which goes by many nicknames including Rat Pox, is believed to be magical in nature and thus can’t easily be cured. Symptoms begin with a simple cough, after which the subjects start to grow rat-like features such as whiskers, hairy ears, claws, fur, and tails. It’s feared the final stage turns residents into actual rats.
* Nobody knows of the outbreak yet because they managed to cover it up as a bunch of road work. They fear that if word should spread, everyone would get into a giant panic, that would be good for no-one. 
* The entirety of [[Force Gray]] is focused on discovering the root of the outbreak and, hopefully, its cure. He thought he had a lead when a retired sea captain, Jerald Brisby, sent a message claiming that he had top secret information about the truth behind Rat Pox.
	When telling this point: the following monologue is possible:
	
	The old man said it was part of something
	bigger, but the truth was too dangerous to
	write down. He wanted to meet in person
	Now I don’t mind troubles, but this thing

	had trap written all over it in explosive
	ink. We took the walk, but I made sure
	I was packing my hand crossbow.

* Captain Brisby didn’t show for their rendezvous, and Staget fears the worst. He’s found the captain’s address, but it’s inside the quarantine zone and staget doesn’t want to risk his health chasing up the lead. 
* He can't send in [[Force Gray]] agents because the dangers are a bureaucratic nightmare and they don't have enough time to spare, they need action taken now. 
* He says the civilians inside the quarantine zone are planning a prayer march this evening. He expects the characters to complete their investigation before the march, called the Salvation Parade, concludes
* If the characters investigate what happened to the captain, and uncover the “truth", they'll be rewarded handsomely, the reward however, cannot be disclosed, the only thing they can know is that serving the city is rewarded handsomely.

If they do accept, hand them a signed paper allowing them entry at the QZ border and a map leading towards Brisby's home

# Entering the Quarantine zone
The players walk up toward the quarantine zone.

"You arrive at a guard station roadblock littered with signs reading "Entry forbidden". In front of you are 2 guards manning guarding the only entry / exit nearby. You see that to attempt to contain the infection they used large curtains to circle around the perimeter of the QZ, going as high as the neighboring buildings. A guard stops you when you get close by the gap in the curtains, and says "Halt. Due to an ongoing investigation no-one is permitted to enter or leave this section of the Dock Ward.""

Queue roleplay to enter the zone. 

They should be going towards the crime scene afterward. 




# Seeing the effects
Upon entering the QZ the players can feel that the air is "wrong". And some smog lingers around coming from gutters and the vibes are very gloomy.

Constitution saving throw DC 12.
Also roll on long rests.
Upon failing roll D6. 
![[Rats effects.png|600]]

Living creatures get these effects .
Mickey gets these effects in his normal form and whenever he wants to use them.
Bolt gets either rusty spots or heightened senses, depending on effect. He does not get a tail but a malfunctioning chance. 

Use tail whenever they roll low for something. 





# The crime scene 
Traveling through the Dock Ward, the characters witness many destitute and sick residents huddled along the streets, with rodents skittering everywhere. Captain Brisby lives in a shabby tenement building on Cloak Lane. They arrive at the apartment building Brisby lives in. The front door of the complex is wide open, everyone can walk in or out. 

When arriving at captain brisby's apartment door, they find the door locked. 
perception check reveals: 
- A doormat reading "Welcome and bugger off."
- A potted plant dying to the right of the door.
- A peephole that has been blocked from the other side.

There is a reserve key under the plant pot. 

Let them find a way in. 




## Entering the apartment 
"You open the door, and you find the room looking as red as a hobgoblin caught with his pants down. A strong smell of blood lingers in the apartment and you find a body deeper what would be the living room. The apartment looks barebones but has some of the essentials, a living room, a bedroom, and a kitchen. "

The players can do some investigation here. 

- The body
	- The captain’s corpse is covered in puncture wounds and lies in a pool of blood. Any character investigating the body can discern tiny rodent bite and claw marks everywhere. Judging by the wounds, they didn’t prey on the body after death: they took his life! The bloody trails of tiny clawed feet are easily tracked. The tracks lead out of the window, and down the street.
		- These lead to [[Rats - Part 2#Temple of rot]] 
	- Any character searching the body and succeeding on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a tiny piece of parchment hidden in the captain’s left sock. The note has the letters “HH” and the numbers “908” scribbled on it. 
		- Combined with the newspaper, which includes an advertisement for the local bank, the note leads to [[Rats - Part 2#Harbor holdings]] 
- The bedroom
	- Whoever looks in the bedroom can find something hidden under the bed, a newspaper containing a clue that leads to [[Rats - Part 2#Dock wards Apothecary]] 
	- They find:
	- ![[Straight talk from the docks.png]]
		- The main story details a feud between the ‘Rat King’ and the ‘Lady of Plagues’. Characters who read this can make a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check to recall the following information:
			- Rat Kings are the legendary, unseen guardians of sewers, back-alleys, and slums. When fire, disease, or invasion threatens a Rat King’s domain, it steps from the shadows to defend it.
			- According to legend, each large city in the North has its own mysterious Rat King (who may be male or female). To become a Rat King, the existing Rat King must be driven off or slain.
			- The Rat King represents the spirit of the urban sprawl, where the weak perish and the mob rule. Each Rat King can summon swarms of vermin to fight at their side.
		- The Lady of Plagues is more of an enigma, but any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check recalls that some druids follow the Circle of Plagues. These zealots believe nature is strengthened by regular culls, and thus visit cities to spread pestilence and disease.
- The Kitchen 
	- Any character searching the kitchen finds the icebox and a carton of crackers. The icebox is full of cheese. Every type of cheese. The smell is overwhelming. On the countertop you can see a fruit bowl with quite some rotten grapes.
		- These clues are useful if characters go to Harbor Holdings in Part 2.
- The living room. 
	- Any character searching the living room finds framed and colored sketches of the captain with a young child. The girl has red hair and a wealth of freckles. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that one of the sketches has the words “Cat, Age 6” written on the back. 
		- This clue is useful if the characters go to Harbor Holdings in Part 2.

After all of this they can head out to their next desired location. 

# Enter the kingping
"When walking out of the building you encounter a group of some bandits and thugs. Behind them is a mind flayer and a gazer. These are a part of the [[Xanathar Guild]]. Upon seeing you the mind flayer passes through the thugs and grabs one of his many orbs from his belt, holding it in the palm of his hand and tapping it with his finger. Before you can do anything the orbs springs alive and an eye shows through it, you hear a deep voice coming from the stone."

“So, the worthless City Watch don't even dare to cross the barricade, sending randoms instead. Here to investigate a ‘crime’, no doubt?”

Without saying anything he continues

"Wait you're telling me these are the lowlife "adventurers" that meddled with our business... which is the one that caught your attention?"

The mindflayer points the eye towards [[Lucyus]] 

"Hmmm interesting find Nihiloor, make sure they grab him alive."

The orb turns back toward the party. 

“Everybody knows you people have treated me very unfairly. It’s disgusting. Really, I think you should apologize.”

Do some other random lines if applicable

- “What leads do you have? No, don’t tell me, I can tell from your faces. Nobody can read a face like me.”
- “I love the people of the docks. Love ‘em. And they love me. That’s why I’m here, to see they’re well cared for. Unlike your City Watch.”




After some time if combat hasn't ensued yet, Xanathar will command them to clean up. At that point [[Nihiloor]] and the gazer will float away and the bandits will start combat.

3 bandits and 2 thugs

```statblock

The thugs carry a combined 30 gp in loose change and cheap jewelry. One of them has a pearl carved like an eye sewn into his bandana (20 gp).

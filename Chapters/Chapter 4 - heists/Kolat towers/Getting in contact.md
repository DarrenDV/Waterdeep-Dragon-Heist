The party decided they wanted to start with the zhentarim heist first

Brok goes to the party:

"Alright gang so you're gonna tackle the zhents first right? The thing that we're missing the most with the zhents is information, and storming kolat towers could be a death trap. Luckily my brother sindri has infiltrated their ranks. You're gonna pull him out by faking his death. I can set up a contraband deal with the zhents which he will be joining. You'll probably be able to make quick work of it so I think you'll still be able to do some more preparation if you want afterwards, I think the information he brings will be worth it."



#### The meeting
Moving your way into the field ward you approach the meeting spot, an alleyway tucked behind some buildings. The alleyway begins small, barely allowing a cart to pass through, but ultimately opens up in a larger cargo-dock like opening, with multiple back-entrances of buildings on each end. In the middle you can see some zhents, together with a smaller gnome who waives at you to come close. The zhents are loading barrels out of their carriage. 
The gnome opens: "Hey there guys! You didn't bring your own carriage? haha"
"Come take a look at the product" and he waves one of the people to come over. 

When a player approaches Sindri will attempt to open up the barrel but is quickly stopped by one of the zhent enforcers that places his hand on the barrel. 

PERCEPTION CHECK - If success, the player sees that the barrel did an odd movement after having the lid almost opened.

Let the players and Sindri rp it out a bit until it's time for the actual sale.

When that happens have one of the zhents say the following:

"Sindri, why are we even dealing with these guys."
Where another one says
"Yeah, you're never this eager to do some actual work."
Another says
"You did this so hastefully..."

Sindri tries to reason by saying something akin to
"Well the oppertunity fell on my lap and it seemed like such a great way to generate some money."

The first guys says
"Don't lie to us Sindri, they found the paper birds you sent to this Brok."
"You know what we have to do now don't we..."

At this point sindri grabs a dagger and slices the throat of the guy next to him.

Queue combat

At the end of the first enemy turn 4 of the barrels will burst open revealing their plasmoid inhabitants, trained as an elite zhentarim squad for taking out the players. 
The plasmoids recognize sticky mickey as a fellow plasmoid but have orders to follow so they will attack. Mickey can say something but they'll respond, "Orders are Orders".

#### After combat
When combat is over sindri hurried says
"Let's get out of here before more of them show up! I'll tell you whatever you want when I get to Brok."

The gang (hopefully) brings him back to the bar

Brok and Sindri reunite and give eachother a big hug, whereafter brok quickly grabs a keg of ale to give to his brother. 
They quickly fall into deep conversation about their adventures and experiences. 

When prompted about the information sindri has, sindi says:

"I know quite some stuff about the zhents, let me start by who:"
"The leader is a wizard named mansoon, he wants the stones to get ahold of the magic items and funds down in the vault to fund his militia."
"He is having a large wizard show off competition with some wizard down in the dungeon of the mad mage (under waterdeep) (hole in yawning portal)."
"Whilst the mad mage down under is giving him a distraction. He does plan on overthrowing waterdeeps government once he has beaten the mad mage."

"He has employed plasmoids as a resiliant but obtainable militia using a prisoner of his, he forces some monk to direct plasmoids from the astral plane to his tower, where he indoctrinates them into his forces."
"Almost all of the important stuff happens in the upper floors of the tower, but those are only accessible by high level zhentarim wizards. Other floors are occupied by regular forces."

He has a floor plan of the building obtained from the buildings archives. 

"I don't know where the stone is but I'd guess probably close to his study / workspace."

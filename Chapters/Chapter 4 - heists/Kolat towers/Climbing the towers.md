Arriving at the towers you are quickly met by a pair of tall but dilapidated towers that look void of life. No zhentarim are seem anywhere in front or around the building. Around 20-30 feet up in the air, a small wooden brigde connects the 2 towers to one another.

### Kolat towers
![[Kolat towers gm.png]]
##### K1
The outer door is locked from the inside, and the room has neither heat nor light sources. Crates stacked around the room are packed with meat, and bear the seal of the Fellowship of Salters, Packers, and joiners.

##### K2
DINING ROOM
This room contains the following features: 
Three Zents in black armor sit around a stone dining table, playing Poker. The table is set with silver. 
• Eight moth-eaten banners hang from the walls. Each bears an arcane sigil that represents a different one of the eight schools of magic. 
Zhents. The card players are Sidra Romeir  and two subordinates (LE male Tethyrian human thugs). Since the force field around Kolat Towers keeps out riffraff, Sidra assumes the characters are guests of Manshoon arriving for a clandestine meeting. If the characters give her no reason to believe otherwise, she and her thugs escort them wherever they ask to go. If it becomes clear that the characters don't belong in the towers, Sidra and her thugs attack. Combat in this area draws the attention of Manafret Cherryport in area K3, who investigates. Sidra wears a teleporter ring (see "Teleporter Rings," page 157). 
Treasure. Silverware on the table is worth 100 gp.

##### K3
Kitchen 
Mouthwatering scents fill this room, which contains the following features: 
• If he hasn't already been drawn elsewhere, a portly halfling stands atop a stool and cooks at an iron stove. 
• A green, ghostly hand floats above a trellis table, holding a knife and cutting carrots and celery. 
• A staircase curves up one wall, leading to area K7.

Zhent Cook. The halfling, Manafret Cherryport, is one of Manshoon's lieutenants. He loves to cook, and uses his mage hand cantrip to cut vegetables. He assumes the characters are intruders unless convinced otherwise. Any ability check to do so is made with disadvantage, since Manafret knows that Manshoon would have informed him if guests were expected. If the mage suspects the characters are intruders, he surreptitiously pours a vial of assassin's blood (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) into the stew before asking them to taste it and give him an honest critique. He then cries out to the guards in area K2 and attacks. Combat in this area draws the attention of the Zhents in areas K2 and K7 , who investigate. 

Manafret is a lightfoot halfling mage, with these changes: 
• Manafret is neutral evil and has 31 (9d6) hit points. 
• He has these racial traits: He is Small , and his walking speed is 25 feet.
He can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. 
He has advantage on saving throws against being frightened. 
He speaks Common and Halfling.

Manafrel wears a teleporter ring (see "Teleporter Rings," page 157).

An invisible staircase with no railings (see "Kolat Towers Features," page 149) hugs the wall asit climbs from the landing to area K11.
• Across from the landing, a wide stone ledge protrudes from the northeast wall beneath a window. A pair of identical wooden chests sits atop the ledge. (One chest is real. The other is a mimic .) 
Ledge. There's no easy way to access the ledge, which is 8 feet away from the landing and at the same height. 
Characters can try to jump onto the ledge, or they can hook a rope onto the railing on the level above (area Kll) and swing across the gap. They can also use magic to cross. Anyone who falls off the landing or the ledge lands in area K4 , 20 feet below.

##### K7
A burly halforc clad in black leather armor sits in an overstuffed chair in the northernmost corner of the room, reading a book. 
• Large framed pictures of cities and landscapes hang on the walls, and a worn, blood-spattered rug covers the floor. Other furnishings include a pair of rocking chairs, a couch, and an ottoman. 

Mouthwatering scents rise from a staircase that curves down to the kitchen (area K3).

Zhent . 
Yorn the Terror is reading a copy of Volo'S Guide to Monsters, autographed on the title page by the author with an added note that reads, in Common: "For Yorn. I hope you find the ore chapter illuminating!" 
Yorn is a half-orc thug, with these changes: 
• Yorn is neutral evil. 
• He has these racial traits: When reduced to 0 hit points, he drops to 1 hit point instead (but can't do this again until he finishes a long rest). 
He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. 
He speaks Common and Ore. 

Yorn values his own well-being above all else. He isinitially indifferent toward intruders. If Yorn believes the characters aren't a threat, he's happy to chat with them about the inhabitants and the layout of Kolat Towers. 

He has never visited Manshoon's extraplanar sanctum, but he does know that the teleportation circle in area K22 is the way to get there. Combat in this area draws the attention of Manafret Cherryport in area K3, who investigates. 

Treasure. Yorn carries 36 cp, 20 sp, 12 gp, 8 taols, and a gem-studded ivory toothpick (worth 25 gp) in a pouch.

##### K8
Small bedroom with nothing special

##### K9
A wooden bridge connects the two towers 20 feet above the ground, and a walkway attached to the bridge encircles the outside of the outer tower. The bridge and the tower walkway lack railings. Their planks and stones groan and crack underfoot but are safe to walk on.

##### K10
This level of the outer tower consists of a landing and a narrow ledge with the following features: The landing is 10 feet square and is met by two staircases. One descends 20 feet to area K5, and one ascends 20 feet to area K20. 

• The narrow ledge built into the southeast wall has a life-size statue of a bearded human wizard standing atop it. The wizard looks angry and is leveling a stone wand at the door to area K9. 

Statue. The statue depicts Duhlark Kolat, and a detect magic spell or similar magic reveals an aura of transmutation magic around it. The first time a character steps onto the landing, the statue levitates 1 foot above the ledge and intones the following warning in Common:
"I am Duhlark Kolat, the great wizard and master of this tower! How dare you invade my home! leave at once or be destroyed by magic beyond your comprehension!" 
The threat is empty, but the statue continues to levitate for 1 minute before sinking back down to the ledge. The magic resets after 1 hour. While it is levitating, the statue can be easily pushed or pulled around. Casting dispel magic on the statue while it's floating causes it to fall, topple off the ledge, and shatter in area K5 below. Anyone in that area when the statue fall s must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage.


##### K11
This room consists of a ledge connected to the levels above and below by invisible staircases (see "Kolat Towers Features," page 149). One staircase descends 20 feet to area K6, and the other climbs 20 feet to area K15. The area contains the following features: • Shattered glass covers the floor, and a large wooden trellis table has been knocked on its side . • A large empty cabinet dominates the back wall. This laboratory has been picked clean by Manshoon and contains nothing of value
##### K12 Hallway
##### K13 Empty holding cell, containing symbols of a monastic order scratched in the walls


##### K14
This room contains the following features: 
• Furnishings include four beds, a small table with four chairs, and tattered window curtains. 
Four Zhent thugs relax here, one trying to rest, two others playing cards, and the fourth sitting on the edge of a bed, re-stringing a heavy crossbow. 
The thugs work for Manshoon and leap up to attack anyone they don't recognize as one of their own. A successful DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check convinces these Zhents that the characters are their allies. Treasure. Resting in small piles and neat stacks on the table are 74 cp, 52 sp, 19 gp, and 4 taols.

```statblock

##### K15
This room is connected to the levels above and below by invisible staircases
one descending 20 feet to area K11 and the other climbing 20 feet to area K16. This area contains the following features: 
• A 10-foot-diameter circle of runes has been drawn on the floor in blood that is now dried. Smoke billows from four iron braziers placed around the circle. Three apprentice wizards stand outside the circle, chanting an incantation. A barlgura is slumped motionless within the circle. 
The three wizards here are Manshoon's apprentices. Each wears a teleporter ring. The magical incantation that the three are reciting has quelled the barlgura and rendered it unconscious. If any of them stop chanting, the demon awakes and becomes enraged, though it remains bound within the circle. Whenever it takes damage, the barlgura can attempt a DC 10 Charisma check. On a successful check, it breaks out of the circle and atcacks any creature it can reach. Freeing the barlgura disrupts Manshoon's operation, forcing the wizard to spend time and resources defeat- ing the fiend and replacing slain underlings
![[Apprentice Wizard.png]]
![[barlgura.png]]


##### K16
A dilapidated construct workshop. It looks like it has been ransacked completely and metal scrap lies everywhere on the floor and desks. A staircase going up has collapsed in on itself.

##### K17 Hallway

##### K18 
This unlit hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. It contains the following features: 
• An elaborate rune is inscribed on the back wall at the southern most end of the hall. (The rune isn't visible from the doorway to area K17.) 
• A secret door is set into the innermost wall. Arcane Rune. A detect magic spell or similar magic reveals a powerful aura of conjuration magic around the rune. A successful DC 15 intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that this rune sustains the force field around Kolat Towers, and that the rune can be destroyed. It has AC 10, 22 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The rune can't be dispelled normally. but each successful dispel magic cast on it (DC 19) deals 16 (3d10) force damage to it. The first time damage is dealt to the rune, a red slaad magically springs forth from it and attacks all creatures in the hallway. When the rune is destroyed, the force field around Kolat Towers disappears. 
Secret Door. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the secret door that leads to area K 19.
##### K19
This room is accessible through either of the secret doors that lead to areas Kl7 and Kl8. It contains the following features: 
A flameskull bobs in the middle of the room, which is choked with dust and cobwebs. 
• An oval canopy bed veiled in cobwebs sits across from two narrow bookshelves. 
• The room smells like a tomb. Manshoon found Duhlark Kolat's skeletal remains in the bed and transformed his skull into a flameskull. He left the rest of the bones alone, hidden behind cobwebs. The fiameskull attacks anyone other than Manshoon who confronts it. shouting, "Get out of my house!" between casting spells and throwing off fire rays. 

Book shelves. Manshoon removed any tomes of value from the bedroom, leaving noticeable gaps on the shelves between mundane books on a variety of esoteric subjects. Among the volumes on one shelf is a false book titled The Man from Damara- a wooden block painted to resemble a book, which is wired to a secret compartment in the base of the shelf. A character can detect the shelf and discern how to open it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Tugging on the book causes the compartment to pop open, revealing Duhlark's wand of binding hidden inside

![[flameskull.png]]


##### K20 Small dusty library
##### K21 Small dusty libaray
##### K22 
A staircase rising from area K21 leads to this highest chamber of the outer tower. 
It contains the following features: 
• four flying snakes flutter above the rafters. 
• Runes inscribed on the floor form a large, faintly glowing circle. 
Teleportation Circle. The teleportation circle functions as described under the spell of the same name in the Player's Handbook. Additionally, a creature wearing a teleporter ring can use this circle to access the teleportation circle in Manshoon's sanctum (area E1). 
A teleporter ring that is brought within 5 feet of the circle begins to hum softly. 





### Extradimensional sanctum
At first when using the teleporter ring is used nothing really seemed to change. That is until looking towards the left and right of the room where a window has appeared. Looking through the right window the entire city seems to have vanished, turning into a distorted realm polluted by weirdly deformed objects and feint voices being carried by the wind. Looking towards the left window a black robed female human with a bald head can be seen, looking towards the players.
Siebren recognizes these voices as voices he has heard in his head, the echo dimension. 

Outside Manshoon's sanctum, the demiplane is a vast void filled with swirling purple mist. Any creature that enters this mist is teleported to area E1 and must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Doors are made of iron and have AC 19, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A locked door can be picked by someone who makes a suc- cessful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or can be forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. As an action, Manshoon or his simulacrum can lock or unlock any door in the sanctum by touch.

![[Extradimensional Sanctum gm.png]]

##### E1 Arrival point 
Dreadful Host. The figure watching through the window is Kaevja Cynavern (see area E3), and she can see through the purple mist between the two rooms easily enough. She uses a sending spell to contact Manshoon as soon as the characters arrive. Manshoon sends his simulacrum (see appendix B) to unlock the door to area E2 and greet the new arrivals. It takes 1 minute for the simulacrum to arrive (from area E7), during which time Kaevja uses another sending spell to inform a random character that "Your gracious host is on the way, and looks forward to meeting you." When the simulacrum arrives, it passes itself off as Manshoon as it welcomes the characters to its extradimensional sanctum. It offers a guided tour, gesturing for the characters to enter area E2 ahead of it. If they comply, it triggers the alarm in area E2 and attacks.

##### E2
The door to area E1 is locked. All other doors leading from this room are unlocked. This foyer bas the following features: 
• Set into the alabaster floor is a large symbol in black marble, depicting a winged snake biting a coin. Characters recognize this as the symbol of the Zhentarim. (The coin conceals an alarm mechanism.)
Alarm Mechanism. The I-foot-diameter, disk-shaped tile that serves as the coin in the Zhentarim symbol is actually a pressure plate. When pressed or stepped on, it sounds a magic gong that can be heard throughout the sanctum. The alarm can be disabled by someone who makes a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, but it triggers accidentally if the check fails by 5 or more. The alarm brings the following defenders, who attack all intruders in the room:
Kaevja Cynavern (see area E3) 
![[zhentarim sorcerer.png]]
The Manshoon simulacrum (see area E7) - has 12 ac and no lv 6 or higher spells
![[manshoon.png]]

Ravia Quickknife and Mookie Plush (see area E10)
![[zhentarim sergeant.png]]

##### E3
A 5-foot-square window in this area looks out toward area E1. Unless she has been drawn elsewhere, Kaevja Cynavern stands watch in front of the window. Kaevja was a Red Wizard of Thay until she saw an opportunity to study magic under Manshoon. Before he accepted her, Manshoon forced her to remove her distinctive Thayan head tattoos and to trade in her Red Wizard robes for black ones. Kaevja Cynavern is a female Mulan human mage. with these changes: 
• Kaevja is Lawful evil. 
She knows Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, and Elvish. 
• She has the sending spell prepared instead of the fly spell, and she carries a yellow elemental gem.

##### E4

• Floor-to-ceiling shelves are stuffed with breads, cheeses, dried meats, nuts, and a few baskets of fresh produce.
• Two barrels labeled "WATER" and two labeled "ALE" are crammed into a comer.

##### E5
This room contains the following features: 
• Beakers, bottles, and test tubes are set on a marble table in the middle of this room, next Lo a basin of water. 
One staircase descends 10 feet to area E2. and another ascends 10 feet to area E6.

##### E6 - Prison Chamber
In this prison chamber, marcellus wallace is being suspended midair frozen statically. Manshoon is using marcellus as a proxy to summon plasmoids towards him at will. With marcellus being a forced beacon so to speak. 
Marcellus is essentially a vegetable in this state, and cannot interact with anyone during his stasis. 

When manshoon is defeated and the spell on marcellus dies down he lies unconscious on the floor inside of the prison chamber. He'll awake when he's brought back to the yawning portal where he'll have a reunion with stickey mickey and such. 

##### E7
This room is extremely cold and contains the following features: 
Frigid air blows into the room through small vents in the Boor. 
In the middle of the room is an open sarcophagus carved from ice, which contains a humanoid figure made of snow. 
• The back wall is made of 5-inch-thick curved glass. Frost covers the glass, partially blotting out the swirling purple mist of the demiplane beyond. 

Simulacrum.
If it hasn't been summoned elsewhere, Manshoon's simulacrum (see appendix B) is standing before the glass wall with its back to the door. The simulacrum resembles a robed wizard with long black hair, pale skin, and an articulated metal left hand and forearm. Its face is concealed behind a steel mas k that bears a smiling visage. The simulacrum attacks anyone it doesn't recognize.

##### E8
Delightful warmth radiates from a brazier of green flame encircled by eight cushioned chairs . 
• Unless they've been drawn elsewhere, two plasmoids are chilling
An a labaster staircase ascends 10 feet to area E9.


##### E9
Alabaster shelves line every wall and jut out into the cent er of this room, all of them packed with books that deal with subjects of interest to wizards. Manshoon has amassed a sizable collection, including ten rare volumes he removed from Duhlark Kolat's collection. Treasure. Each rare book is worth 5 gp, and the entire collection is worth 500 gp.


##### E10
High-ranking Zhents who desire an audience with Manshoon come here. The room contains the following features: The area is split into two levels, with alabaster steps climbing 3 feet to a smaller raised platform overlooking the larger area. 
The platform is bare except for three golden banners hanging on the back wall, each displaying the symbol of the Zhentarim, a black, winged snake biting a coin. 
• The lower part of the room contains a black marble table surrounded by high-backed wooden chairs. The table stands out in stark contrast against the alabaster walls and floor. 
• If they haven't been drawn elsewhere, two of Manshoon's followers are sparring and engaged in mock fisticuffs atop the table.  

Zhents. 
Two female lightfoot halflings-Havia Quick knife and Mookie Plush- believe that Manshoon is the rightful leader of the Zhentarim. They serve him fearlessly, and will sacrifice themselves to ensure that his plans come to fruition. They are martial arts adepts (see appendix B), with these changes: 
• Havia and Mookie are lawful evil. • They have 49 (11d6 + 11) hit points each. 
They have these racial traits: 
They are Small, and their walking speed is 25 feet. 
They can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. 
They have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. 
They speak Common and Halfling. 
Havia and Mookie each wear a teleporter ring



##### E11 Zhent Quarters
Just some quarters



##### E12
No one aside from Manshoon is allowed down here. 
The alabaster stairs that lead to this room descend 10 feet farther to area E13. 

This room contains the following features: 
• Across from the stairs stands a large bed with purple sheets. Sitting on the edge of the bed is a handsome young male human in elegant robes . Long black hair partially conceals his angelic face as he attaches a metal appendage to the withered stump of his left arm. 

The only other piece of furniture is a table with legs carved to resemble winged serpents . 

Displayed on the table is a meta l mask with an intimidating, tyrannical visage. The handsome young figure is Manshoon, who is much older than he looks.  

This version of Manshoon isn't spoiling for a fight. He commends the characters for making it this far and shows no concern for the Zhents they defeated to reach him, since he considers all his followers expendable. The characters' best chance of survival is to convince Manshoon that they can be cowed or bribed into working for him. Weary of his conflict with the Xanathar Guild, Manshoon suggests that the characters prove their usefulness to him by hunting down and killing Xanathar in its lair. 

Manshoon also demands that they keep his presence in Waterdeep a secret for now, saying that he will reward them for their discretion "when the time comes." In exchange, he allows the characters to return to Waterdeep and promises them positions of power in his organization once Xanathar's death is confirmed. 

He has no intention of making good on this promise, but refusing to work for him puts the characters in a tight spot, since the evil archwizard can't risk exposure. 

If a fight breaks out, Manshoon grabs his staff of power (which he hides under the bed) and holds his ground. For more information on how to play Manshoon

![[manshoon.png]]
During the first phase of the fight, manshoon will teleport one room further, lock the door behind him, and spawn 2 plasmoids in the room with the party. He will continue this up until E1.
In E1 he summons some more allies (depending on party strength), but does spawn a plasmoid boss 
![[plasmoid boss.png]]

##### E13
The a labaster stairs end here. The room contains the following features: 
• A plush lavender carpet covers the floor. 
• In one far corner of the room, a low table is set between two purple couches. The table has a thin drawer built into it. In the other far corner, Manshoon's spellbook rests atop a black marble lectern protected by an invisible helmed horror. The construct attacks anyone other than Manshoon who disturbs the book (becoming visible as it does so). It obeys Manshoon's commands if he is present, and it fights until destroyed. 
Table. 
The table's drawer has an arcane lock spell cast on it. The spell can be bypas sed by someone who makes a success ful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or with a knock spell or similar magic. The drawer can also be forced open with a success- ful DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check. The drawer contains a special crafted ritual for creating and maintaining an echo dimension stronghold. Unlocks the next [[Echo dimension research]]  for siebren.

Manshoon's Spellbook . See book.
![[manshoon spellbook.png]]

On a small pedestal in the middle of the room, in a small glass container. Is a small black marble displayed, which looks exactly similar to the eye that should fit in the stone.

A giant bomb could probably cause quite a bit of damage, but be careful with all that magic around it haha!

During my time undercover, I've heard talk about gondian gnomes in waterdeep, so that's probably your best bet for this stuff. You can probably just follow some gnomes near the warehouses in the dock ward and you'll find a group of them. Just as a heads up though, I would try to strike a deal, one is easily beatable but more could swarm you like rats. 


## The dock ward
After walking for some while in the dock ward some gnomes can be seen walking around. They are headed toward mistshore, a small subsection of the docks occupied by the gnomes.

If they follow the gnomes really suspiciously they'll walk faster and alert the other gnomes they're being followed. 

Ultimately they arrive at mistshore


Mistshore is a subsection of the docks occupied by the gnomes. 
There are a couple of notable NPC's :

1. **Tinkertop Gearwizzle**: A charismatic Gondian gnome, key negotiator, and engineer. Prefers trading over fighting but is fiercely protective of his inventions.
2. **Grizzleboom Fizzflick**: The group's enforcer, equipped with various explosive gadgets.
3. **Pip Squeakover**: A lookout, not very brave but extremely quick and alert.
4. **Gondian Gnome Workers**: Several other gnomes working in the warehouse, cautious but curious.


###### Approach:

1. **Tracking the Gnomes**: The party can start by observing the Dock Ward, noticing that certain gnomes exchange secret signs and disappear into a nondescript warehouse. Stealth or persuasion checks can help them follow without raising alarm.
2. **Initial Contact**: Approaching Tinkertop Gearwizzle requires either a direct approach or clever subterfuge. Tinkertop is open to trade but wary of strangers, especially those who might misuse his inventions.
3. **Negotiation or Deception**: Tinkertop asks for a rare item or a favor in exchange for the gunpowder. Alternatively, players might try deceiving him by posing as buyers or officials. Success depends on role-play quality and dice checks.
4. **Complications**:
    - **Ambush**: If negotiations sour or the party's presence is leaked, Grizzleboom and a few workers armed with explosive devices might attempt an ambush.
    - **Theft Option**: Sneaking into the warehouse to steal the gunpowder could trigger traps or alert Pip Squeakover, initiating a chase or combat.
    - **External Threat**: During negotiations, an external party (rival thieves, city guards alerted to a tip-off, etc.) could raid the warehouse, forcing both the party and the gnomes to temporarily align.


Just do a bunch of RP.

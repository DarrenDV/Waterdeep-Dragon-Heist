Brok goes to the party:
"Hey guys, now that you've managed to retrieve the Zhents' eye, we only have Xanathars left. The unfortunate thing about the next heist is that we don't have anyone on the inside, so information is scarce. That being said, looking at the board you do have multiple ways of entry, you have a teleporter stone which you could probably use to get deep into their stronghold, but I also saw that you managed to get some arena invites, with those they'll probably let you right in, Xanathar definitely does love a show."

Regarding the exit strategy, you managed to clear out Kolat Towers without destroying it, so the gnomes are probably willing to offer you that runepowder bomb now, you could use it to possibly destroy a portion of or the entire stronghold, or deal a lot of damage to Xanathar himself.

Is there anything you want to do, otherwise I can give some suggestions...
You can try to find a higher up Xanathar guild member and try to pry some information out of him
You could use some of that dancing gloomdust I was talking about earlier

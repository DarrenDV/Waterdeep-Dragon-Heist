Upon docking the boat the shipper says in a gruff voice "follow me please"

When stepping foot on the docks you can see that all of the population is dressed mostly shadely, some of the party are sticking out like a sore thumb. 
The shipper says "we get some of yall every day, so you're no new sight, but dont try anything funny."

As he says this you can see multiple people unloading other boats with crates labeled "fish food" onto the docks.
A different boat can also be seen at the far back of the dock, loading what looks like a large cage of the boat into skullport. The cage however has a drape hanging over it, so its contents cannot be seen. 

The shipper waves to follow, slowly navigating some alleys until arriving at a more open plaza close to the docks. 

The shipper stops in the middle of the plaza, dried up water fountain and tells the party: "You're a bit early actually, but thats no big deal, I'll meet you guys back here in 1 hour and then we'll be ready to go"
"We'll head over there then" and he points to a large almost castle like structure with a large overlook high up in the side of a cave wall. 


As the shipper walks away you feel stared at, but not by the people around you, they're all minding their business. 



### Plaza 
The party now finds themselves at the center of the plaza, with shady looking people moving around them, doing business, transporting goods, and generally going about their day. The party now has around an in game hour to mess a bit around before they should be here again for the fight. 

Looking around, the players are able to find a couple of points of interest, these being: 
* A bar named "The drunken Clam"
* An older looking woman with a small booth containing oddities.
* A child is being chased by an older adult around the plaza 
* A hooded musician playing somber tunes on a violin, most people are just ignoring her though
* Two merchants who are arguing and causing a scene
The party is also free to search for something themselves. 


Walking towards the first POI:

Walking towards xxxx, you spend some more time looking at the surrounding buildings and see that a bunch of them have artwork on the side, posters basically. 
You notice quite a lot of different poster designs but 2 stand out as reoccuring a bunch, these being a large picture of an eye with the underlying text "Always watching, always knowing". 
The 2nd is artwork of a small goldfish inside of a bowl, adorned with rainbow colored ground and a small miniature shipwreck and cove. The fish takes the center stage however and is put in the best light possible. 
Inspecting the 2nd piece of artwork shows a small bit of text in the bottom right corner reading "Sylgar" with a little heart next to it.


When walking from the first POI roll a perception check on BOLT. If med-high:
Looking back at the plaza you see something in the corner of your eye, normally unnoticed but you recognize something.
Walking at the side of the plaza heading into an alley are a couple of drow, dressed like comical pirates accompanied. There are most certainly the drow of the [[Circus of innovations]]. 
Looking at the way that they're walking, theyre heading towards xanathars lair. 
The party can attempt to catch up to them, but they're quickly walking into another alley and quickly not able to be found again. 




After the hour is up multiple groups of adventurers and people keen on fighting can be found chilling around the plaza, not before long the same shipper shows up and says:
"Thanks for being on time, lets head to the arena yes?"










##### Drunken Clam
Arriving at the drunken clam the first rowdy bunch of taverngoers quickly get silent as a group of adventurers enter the building. If they dont approach the barkeep he'll wave them to him. 
"Welcome to the drunken clam ya'll what can I get fer ya."
"What brings you into town"
"Well if you need to know anything be sure to ask me, barkeeps know a lot ya know. And by everything I mean everything". 
The players can ask general questions about skullport to the barkeep but more in depth questions will require some form of compensation. 



###### Small Encounter Inside the Bar: The Cheating Gambler

**Setup:** While the players are enjoying their drinks and gathering information from Jorven, they notice a commotion at one of the gambling tables. A dwarf named Borrak is accusing a human, Lyle, of cheating in a game of cards.

**Description:** Borrak is a burly dwarf with a fiery temper, and he’s standing up, his face red with anger. Lyle, a sly-looking human, is trying to laugh off the accusations, but he seems nervous. The other patrons are watching with interest, some placing bets on the outcome of the confrontation.

2. **Mediate the Dispute**:
    
    - **Persuasion** (DC 15): The players can try to calm both parties down and suggest a compromise.
    - **Outcome**: If successful, they manage to defuse the situation without violence. Borrak and Lyle reluctantly agree to split the pot and shake hands, though grudgingly.
        - **Jorven’s Approval**: Jorven appreciates the players keeping the peace in his establishment and offers them a small discount on his information services.

        - **Outcome**: Lyle is grateful and offers the players a portion of his winnings or promises to provide information or aid in the future. However, Borrak might hold a grudge against them.




##### Older woman 
Her booth is cluttered with an assortment of oddities, trinkets, and small magical items.
Maelis’s stall is a chaotic mix of old books, strange bones, glass bottles filled with unknown liquids, and other curiosities. She seems to have a perpetual twinkle in her eye and a knowing smile.

- **Item 1: The Ring of Minor Luck**: This simple silver ring grants the wearer a +1 bonus on their next skill check. However, it can only be used once per day.
    - **Price**: 20 gold pieces.
    - **Maelis’s Pitch**: “Ah, a discerning eye you have! This ring here, it’s been known to turn fate just a little in your favor.”
- **Item 2: The Cursed Coin**: A coin that always seems to land on its edge when flipped. It’s said to bring minor misfortune (-1 to the next saving throw) to anyone who carries it for more than a day.
    - **Price**: 5 gold pieces (she doesn’t reveal the curse).
    - **Maelis’s Pitch**: “A curious piece, this one. Never seen a coin quite like it, have you?”




##### Rascal
**Setup:** As the players move through the plaza, they notice a commotion. A young tiefling girl named Kira is being chased by a burly guard. She appears to have stolen something from a merchant’s stall.

**Description:** Kira is quick and nimble, darting through the crowd with a mischievous grin on her face. The guard, a gruff human named Bronn, is less agile but determined.

**Interaction:**

- **Option 1: Help the Thief**: The players can choose to help Kira evade the guard. Doing so might involve creating a distraction, using Stealth to hide her, or even using minor magic to aid her escape.
    - **Outcome**: If they help Kira, she’s grateful and offers a small, non-magical but valuable item she stole (worth 10 gold pieces) and shares some useful information about the arena.
- **Option 2: Help the Guard**: The players can help the guard catch Kira, using Athletics or other means to apprehend her.
    - **Outcome**: If they help Bronn, he thanks them and offers to put in a good word with the local guards, potentially providing some minor assistance or leniency in future encounters.



##### Musician 
**Setup:** In the center of the plaza, a strange figure plays haunting melodies on a violin. The musician, a drow named Selene, seems to captivate the crowd with her music.

**Description:** Selene is dressed in dark, elegant robes. Her music is both beautiful and eerie, casting a spell over those who listen.

**Interaction:**

- **Insight Check**: With a successful Insight check (DC 15), the players notice that Selene is subtly observing the crowd, possibly looking for someone or something.
- **Conversation**: If approached, Selene is enigmatic but friendly. She offers cryptic hints about the arena and Xanathar, possibly warning the players about the dangers they will face.
    - **Hint**: “The eye that sees all has many ways to trap the unwary. Beware the gaze that binds, and the creatures that lurk in shadow.”
- **Reward**: If the players show genuine interest or impress Selene with their own skills (musical or otherwise), she gifts them a small charm (a tiny silver eye) that grants advantage on one saving throw against being frightened.




##### Merchants arguing
As the players explore the bustling plaza, they come across a heated argument between two merchants, Grask the duergar and Yelena the human. The dispute is drawing a small crowd, and tensions are rising.

**Description:** Grask is a stout, grim-looking duergar with a stall filled with weapons and armor, many of which have a dark, sinister appearance. Yelena is a tall, stern woman with a table displaying potions and alchemical supplies. Both merchants are shouting accusations at each other.

**Interaction:**

- **The Dispute**: Grask accuses Yelena of selling him a faulty potion that exploded and ruined some of his wares. Yelena insists her potions are of the highest quality and accuses Grask of sabotaging her stall to drive away customers.
- **Investigation**: The players can step in to mediate. They might use:
    - **Insight** (DC 14) to determine who is lying or hiding something.
    - **Investigation** (DC 15) to examine the potion residue and Grask’s damaged goods.
    - **Persuasion** (DC 16) to calm both parties and suggest a compromise.

**Possible Outcomes:**

- **Resolving the Dispute**: If the players successfully mediate, both merchants are grateful and offer discounts on their wares.
    - **Grask’s Offer**: He provides a choice of a +1 weapon or armor piece at a reduced price.
    - **Yelena’s Offer**: She offers a choice of a Potion of Greater Healing or a Potion of Fire Breath at a reduced price.
- **Failure to Resolve**: If the players fail to resolve the dispute, the argument escalates into a brawl, potentially drawing the attention of Skullport’s guards or other unsavory characters. This can lead to a minor combat encounter or a need for the players to escape unnoticed.

After a long and arduous battle in arena the gang has won themselves an audience with the Xanathar.  

After waiting for some time you hear the rumble of people in the arena start to dissipate. 
Around 15 minutes later the keeper tells the party that the Xanathar is ready for their audience. 

As they're being guided through xanathars lair the party gets a good feeling for the place. The entire lair, whilst being grand in size, is made of primarily shoddy bricks, with large amounts of damage. The air is filled with warm and damp air, as humidity has no place to escape toward. 

As you walk into a hallway, you see a couple of xanathar guild members rolling a cart with barrels down another hallway in. 

Bigger hallways are held in place with pillars which don't feel in place, most likely stolen from someplace else. What is noticable is that most of the walls are still aligned with the same posters as outside. 


You enter a large circular room, distinctly different in design from the other rooms of this stronghold. The walls of the room are aligned with busts of various people and creatures. Under each bust you can see the title "The Xanathar" followed by 2 years. 

The guardian points towards the southernmost door, and tells to the party:
"The Xanathar awaits you in his office"



# The meeting with the xanathar
As you enter the room the large beholder known as The Xanathar has it's back turned towards you. Regardless of that fact 11 eyes, positioned on stakes around his body are facing you. 

Looking around the room you see that it's by far the most dressed up in the entire building. The rooms is decorated with fancy purple lighting, has purple ornaments adorned on the walls and multiple bookshelves with files and folders. The room is however quite dimly lit, and has a sombre feeling. 

In the middle room a large fishbowl with a smaller one next to it is displayed in a grandiose fashion. A small goldfish can be seen swimming inside of the larger fishbowl. 

Xanathar turns around and speaks to the party:
"Well to be honest I had hoped you wouldnt be here right now, but you won so here is your audience. Let me guess, you are here to kill me and steal the eye."

RP some conversation here


"Allow me to give you a small history lesson here, I am the current Xanathar, it is merely a title. Once you kill me someone will take my place just like I did my predecessors. So how about we make a deal?"

"I shall let you leave and take the stone with you, if you let me continue my operations"\

Xanathar also has an offer for lucyus. He knows how to split him and his sister, giving her the ability to live her life again and making things normal. But he's only willing to share this information with lucyus if they agree to a deal.

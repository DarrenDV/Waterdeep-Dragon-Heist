The players are waiting inside of a cell with an open door, multiple other cells are adjecent to them with their own groups of people chatting inside of them. 
An escorter walks towards the party and asks them to follow him.

The party walk toward a door, cheering and chanting can be heard at the other side of it. The door opens and they are on the battlegrounds of an arena. 

The arena is circled by a bunch of spectators, most of which belonging to xanathars guild. On a podium in front of them, Xanathar looks down towards the party. 

A voice starts blaring in the arena. 

"PEOPLE OF SKULLPORT"
"TODAY IS THE DAY THAT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR"
"THE ADVENTURERS THAT HAVE MEDDLED IN THE XANATHARS PLANS HAVE SHOWN UP THEMSELVES TO BRAWL"
"TODAY THEY WILL BATTLE FOR HONOR AND GLORY AGAINST THOSE WHO THINK THEY CAN BEAT THEM"
"THE WINNER WILL GET AN AUDIENCE WITH THE XANATHAR HIMSELF"
"A PRIZE SO GLORIOUS DEATH IS BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR AN ATTEMPT"
"THEIR FIRST OPPONENTS WILL BE NONE OTHER THAN OUR OWN"

After the first battle 


"AND ITS A WRAP"

"THEY DID IT AGAIN"
Xanather looks slightly annoyed
"LETS BRING SOME OF SKULLPORTS FIERCEST WARRIORS INTO THE MIX"
"FIGHT"

during this fight, a goon walks towards xanathar 
"sir I've got a report, one of the cleaners bumped into Sylgar. HE IS FINE THOUGH BUT WAS VISIBLY SCARED. He went to retreat into his cove."
This makes Xanathar enraged
"BRING THAT CLEANER HERE NOW"
When the cleaner arrives xanathar without a word disintegrates them, leaving them to dust. 
The room falls silent when this happens
"Sorry, I lost my cool there. Continue..."


"OH MY GODDDDD"
"THEY DID IT AGAIN, WHO CAN STOP THEMMMMM"
Xanathar looks angry that the party still stands
"Lets go to the final round shall we? This is taking too long"

On a small wooden podium a lion resembling creature is pulled into the arena by 2 of xanathars goons. The creature almost looks made of stone but doesnt seem to move. 
The crowd goes silent when the creature is brought into the arena. 
Another one of xanathars goons runs up on the podium with a small piece of paper in his hand. He starts reading off of it. 

"_O Horn-deck'd beast, from higher plane deliver'd. Take root inside the arenas's sculpted keepers. And perch'd within, we beg of thee; rise._"
The beast starts to rise 
"_Dance and cavort, cleanse all that thou wilt. Cruelty, woe, and those who plague the arena. Cleanse away the strumpet's vile progeny_"
The beast roars.

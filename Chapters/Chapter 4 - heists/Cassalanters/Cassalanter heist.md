# Cassalanter villa

When walking towards the villa you can see that a increasingly thickening fog is enveloping not only the house, but the block surrounding it as well. Currently the fog isn't as thick as when you were in the forest.

Cedric can recognize the the features as some people from his old village, two elder gentlemen who were parents at some houses around him. They do recognize cedric as well but are somewhat hostile. As long as the party does not exercise caution around the gentlemen they'll attack. Accompanying the gentlemen are 3 cult followers who are trying to keep them calm. The cultists will not attack the party directly because they are too preoccupied with keeping the golems calm but will attack once combat starts.

##### C16 Piano room - Storage Closet - Powder rooms
##### C17 Playroom
The room is filled with giant stuffed dolls, toys and wooden rocking horses. The room is a mess, and everything is left as if nobody has had time to clean up. There is no-one else present. 

4 Fusions of people using zombie statblocks roam the upper floor. They're obviously people, but merged in such a way that they're not distinguishable as any individual anymore. They produce feint cries and seem focussed on cedric, almost as if they recognize him.

##### C18 Twins bedroom + Closets
Empty holding nothing of value
##### C19 Master Sitting Room
##### C20 Linen Closet
##### C21 Master Bedroom 
The walls are adorned with nine friezes, each one depicting a layer of the nine Hells. 
A four-poster bed draped in deep red curtains and tipped with gold spires stands before an ornate door carved from dark hardwood with a gold latch, the door is unlocked.

A search of the room reveals a golden lockbox tucked under the bed. Golden Lockbox. Both Victoro and Ammalia keep their cult regalia in a solid gold lockbox (worth 750 gp) hidden under their bed. The box can be unlocked with either Victoro's or Ammalia's golden key, or by a character who makes a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. It can also be pried open with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check.

##### C22 Private study

The room contains the following features: 
• The walls are lined with bookshelves packed with thick tomes. 
• A grimoire with a red leather cover sits on a desk carved from dark oak. 
• A ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. 

Book shelves. The books on the shelves include works of fiction and nonfiction. 

Desk. Aside from the grimoire (described below ), the desk holds an ornate golden candlestick (worth 50 gp), a golden inkwell (worth 25 gp), and a feathered quill pen (worth 15 gp ). The desk drawer contains a wax seal bearing the Cassalanter crest. 

Red Grimoire. The tome on the desk, bound in crimson leather, details a diabolical ritual that Ammalia and Victoro enacted to first contact the archdevil Asmodeus . Opening it reveals nothing but blank pages with a few drops of dry blood on them. If a drop of humanoid blood is spilled on any page, lnfernal text on that page becomes legible, remaining so until the book is closed. The blood remains even after the text vanishes.

Any character with the Ritual Casting feature (or the Ritual Caster feat) who spends 24 hours reading the book can master the ritual described within. The ritual takes 11 minutes to cast and requires incense and a vial of unholy water (which are consumed during the performance of the ritual). At the end of the ritual, a proxy of Asmodeus appears and grants its summoner the benefit of a commune spell. The proxy is formed of incense smoke and resembles a pit fiend. A character must finish a long rest before performing the ritual again. 

Trapdoor. The trapdoor in the ceiling is the entrance to the attic.
##### C23 
Attic Landing, simple wooden door is presented for the players, the door is unlocked and a small murmur of chanting can be heard coming from the other side. 

##### C24
Main Attic 
Inside of the attic 3 cult followers are chanting over an pentagram magically locking the temple door. The chanters are aware of the parties entrance into the room but keep chanting. If and when the ritual is disturbed, one Master of Cruelties and 3 dretches spawn, defending the ritual. When the 3 cult followers die, the pentagram dissapears and the door in the basement unlocks.

### Temple of asmodeus
When first walking down into the temple of asmodeus the party finds themselves in something that could only be described as a completely different complex. Walls are made of dark huge deep slate bricks, lined with candles producing very little light. Walls are 20 feet high with arches connecting the sides every 15 feet. The doorway down at the bottom of the stairs is around 10 feet tall, making the party look small in comparison. On top of all of this, a thick haze, presumably caused by the ritual, is limiting vision quite a bit. 

##### A1 Hall of the damned
You traverse down the stairs and come by a crossing, the middle of the crossing contains a set of spiral stairs going further down. Whilst a thick haze keeps blocking sightlines you can hear some sort of wailing coming from south of the crossing. The wailing sounds more akin to human sobs and cries than anything else. 
To the north of where you are located you can hear some feint footsteps going coming near you and going further out, constantly repeating itself. Whilst it is hard to point out, you can hear some sort of chants coming from both that direction and down the stairs. 
Going south leads to the prison A1a.
The stairs lead to A3
North leads to A2


###### A1-a Prison
A large hallway containing multiple cells spans southbound for at least 100 feet. The walls are lined with multiple cells, each packed with prisoners. What's noticeable is that the occupants of each cell do seem random at first, with the only match between them is that it almost looks like they are sorted by clothing and / or skin color. As soon as one of the prisoners see you they start calling for help, in what can only be described as a more southern accent of Common. More prisoners hear the cries of the first cell and slowly each cell's occupants are calling for help. You can now hear that they are calling for help in distinctly different accents and dialects of common. Through the calls for help, cedric is able to pick up a dialect which sounds familiar to him, the dialect spoken in his hometown, which sounds more dutchenglish. 

Walking up to that specific cell, cedric can recognize the occupants of the cell as citizens of his hometown, alive and well. Only a handful of people, including his father seems to be missing. The other prisoners will quickly inform that around 15 minutes ago, a bunch of prisoners picked at random were taken away, and screaming followed soon after. The cells have also been locked using a key only Victoro Cassalanter holds himself. The party is quickly instructed to make haste and potentially save his father. 

RP mushy stuff.



##### A2 - Hallway and balcony
The hallway between the crossway and the balcony is guarded by 2 bearded devils, attempting to keep intruders away from the balcony which could provide them with a vantage point. 

The balcony itself is in a fragile state, anyone approaching can see that a bunch of tiles are on the verge of collapsing. If someone passes over a tile, the tile can collapse, leaving a hole in its place. A person on it needs to make a DC 13 dex saving throw or fall 25 feet down into A7, taking 2d6+2 falling damage. If someone wants do descent after leaving a large enough hole behind them, they can

##### A3 - Anterior Vestibule
The set of spiral stairs down from A1 leads to this chamber. Mounted directly in front of the exit of the stairs is a large 18 foot high, 9 foot wide portrait in a gilded frame. The picture depicts a strikingly handsome and impeccably dressed bearded man with small horns protruding from his forehead. He carries a ruby-tipped cane. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the figure as Asmodeus.

The room is guarded by 2 bearded devils, who are unaware of who the party is due to the haze, but will attack on sight once the party gets close. 

On 2 opposite ends of the staircase are halls leading towards A7, the main ceremonial hall. 2 unlocked thick wooden doors with iron handles keep the room out of sight but chanting and mumbling can be heard from the room, together with the occasional screaming. 

The door to the right leads towards the cassalanter family crypt A4

Another hallway downwards towards the south leads to A5.

##### A4 - Family Crypt
The room you entered is pitch black, only lit by the light coming from the now recently opened doorway. Candles on the walls are long burnt out and the room is covered in dust and cobwebs. You can only have a small glimpse of what the room contains, that being a large amount of decorated stone coffins, before 3 specters and one ghost appear coming out of the walls. The specters are long distorted by time and resemble no discernable human. But the ghost still resembles his old self: a handsome, clean-shaven man of knightly bearing clad in plate armor with a small symbol of Tyr on it's chest. Upon seeing the radiant rainmaker in action, the ghost is able to snap to it's senses, halting it's attack and trying to reason with the specters. The specters wont listen and will continue their attack until they are defeated. 

When the specters are defeated, the ghost will show itself to the party and wave with it's hands to follow him. If the party decides to follow him, he leads them to his tomb and opens it for them. Above the tomb is a painting of the same handsome clean-shaven man, clutching a chalice, with the name "Caladorn Cassalanter" underneath it on a plaque. A history check can reveal that Caladorn was a former masked Lord and Hero of Waterdeep. 
Inside of his sarcophagus lies a skeleton with 2 items; a mace of disruption and +1 plate armor. Upon attempting to grab either one of the items Caladorn asks: "Do you vow to use these items to defeat the forces of darkness?" Upon which any positive reaction the ghost will dissipate, saying: "Use the mace to destroy the effigy of evil incarnate. End the corruption to restore my family's honor." The effigy is referring to the statue in A7. 

The rest of the crypt contains no items of value.

##### A5 Storage
Upon nearing A5 a foul stench can be smelled coming from the room. Approaching it the party is quickly able to discern why. A massive pile of bodies lies in the middle of the room, presumably used for rituals of some sort. What is noticeable however is that some of the bodies piled up in this room wear cult regalia, although very filthy. The sides of the room contain tables with chairs and crates stacked on top suggesting that this room had been repurposed for the storage of bodies.

Someone who is searching the room can find a indented wall, connecting to area A6.

##### A6 Secret Vestry
A6 is a small secretive room between A5 an A7. 

• Against the south wall stand two black wardrobes with nine-pointed stars carved into their doors. 
• A pair of tall, slender mirrors are mounted on the west wall, their stone frames carved with serpents. 
• Stacked in the middle of the room are six casks of wine used for cult celebrations. 
Each wardrobe contains five complete outfits of cult regalia sized for adult humans: red robes, devil masks, and wooden amulets shaped in the symbol of Asmodeus. 

In front of two mirrors you find 2 cult fanatics in the process of dressing themselves

##### A7 - Ceremonial Hall
This is the ceremonial hall. Looking almost as if the entire complex was built around this giant room. The ceiling is a staggering 40 foot tall, with two balconies overlooking the main interior hall. 
On the other side of the room is a giant 30 foot tall statue. The statue depicts a smiling, bearded man of diabolical bent, with small horns protruding from his brow and cloven hooves instead of feet. At the base of the statue, clutched in a stone claw erupting from the floor, is a 3-foot-deep, 9-foot-diameter stone bowl filled with crackling flames. It is the same man depicted in the painting in A3. 
The path towards the statue has been lit with candles on each side. 

Although the thick haze keeps visibility at a minimum, some figures can be seen near the statue. Partly due to crackling flames at the base of the statue and partly due to a green purple-ish circle hovering slightly to the side of the flames. You can see that this fire is also directly fueling the portal. 
Scattered around the room you can see a bunch of people. On the ground in front of the flames lie 2 children, those of the [[Cassalanters]]. With Victoro holding the [[Stone of split persona]] in his hands. Some cultists are standing around a bunch of prisoners including cedrics father. In front of them some adults are already laying on the ground collapsed. Standing between the kids and the adults is a figure only Mickey has had a great look of. The creature called as "The bell" from [[Prehevil]]. 

When the cassalanters notice that the party arrived they'll plead to let them continue their business. "Please stop! We just want to save our kids... We don't want to lose them like we already almost did." Just RP it out until combat. No good enough roll can convince them to stop.

Once combat starts, The bell can be seen being placed in an orb of mist around him, not allowing anything to hurt him. In order to destroy this orb, the statue/flames must be destroyed. The flames CANNOT be destroyed by normal water but could be destroyed by a bunch of holy water or water that has been attacked using cedrics bow. 

During the first turn of combat, the bell will chime his bell a little bit. At first nothing happens but then a large screech can be heard. The pile of bodies in A5 awakens and gets morphed into a large humanoid tank like monster. 

Victoro and Ammalia are both normal cultists and have no special stats themselves.

##### A8 Closet
A8 is a small storage closet containing gold and other ingredients used for rituals by the cult. A coffer containing 250gp can be found together with multiple vases of withered flowers and basket filled with different types of rocks.


##### A9 Stream and pool
An underground stream flows through the west side of the temple and into a 5-foot-deep pool here before meandering northwest and emerging in the Mud Flats.

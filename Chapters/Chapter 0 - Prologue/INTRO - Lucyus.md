# Fine day for thievery

Our session starts at the local market where Lucyus does his swindling and scamming. 

"You find yourself at the start of a sunny summery day in Waterdeep. You're at a smaller local market, where families have stands of trinkets and small farmers are trying to sell their produce. As far as you can see, today is a simple regular day. What do you do."

There is no particular goal to do here. Let him do his thing.




##### Swindling, yay or nay
The pc can now swindle or not. 


**If the PC swindles**
2 drow bandits approach

"What are you doing here?! This is our turf! You know that it's not nice to intrude on other peoples' territory ya'know. Don't you think that's rude."

The bandits will ask for a "tax" on the PC's swindles, around 75% will do. If the PC at any point disregards this, the bandits will quickly start combat

```statblock
monster: Bandit
```





**If the PC does not swindle**
2 bandits approach after some time of the pc laundering about. 

"Hey, we've been keeping an eye on you ya'know. You've been swindling some people on our turf for quite some time now. You don't think that's rude? Swindling on other peoples' territory. Tell ya what, if you give 75% of your latest swindles to us we'll let you go." 

If the PC denies this in any way, start with the bandits attempting to attack

```statblock
monster: Bandit
```




Regardless of outcome, when the fight ensues all the near people start fleeing to get to safety. 




### Justice arrives

After the bandits have been dealt with, some guards show up to assess the situation. They ask general questions pertaining as to what happened and why. The PC can attempt to deceive. Whatever he says, succesful or not, the guards can be seen talking to each other and giving a suspicious look. 
The guards follow up with this phrase:

"Say, your name wouldn't happen to be Lucyus right? Half elf with some magic tricks." 
"We've got multiple reports on a half-elf stealing money and other stuff from people all around."

"You're suspected for swindling, stealing and fraudery. You have the right to remain silent, everything you say can and will be used against you. The judge will decide your outcome in a court of law."


At this point the PC has the choice of fight or flight. Fighting will possibly end up with a higher wanted rating if there are any witnesses. 

Running away leads to the next section. 


**If he gets arrested**
He gets loaded up into cart. When they have been moving for a couple of minutes, the guards receive reports of a clash happening in the dock ward. They will surprisingly actually let Lucyus go free because they have bigger issues to deal with. Poggers. Let them drop him off somewhere on a random ass street.



# Alley hag

When running away the PC starts walking through an alley where he encounters an hag. She'll stop lucyus at the spot. 

"You! There's something about you. Something special. Let me take a look at your hand. LET ME READ YOUR HAND!"

The PC can give their hand or she'll take it forcefully. 

"Yes.... Yes... I can see it. You have power in you boy. Something strong, unnatural. You should watch out.... If the wrong people found out you have this. If Xanathar found out. You'd be in grave danger."

"Take this, it's a coupon for some food and a drink at The Yawning Portal. My friend Threestring plays music there, tell him you're a friend of Enya. He'll protect you in whatever way he sees fit. I know what you've done, I see it. But don't worry, he doesn't discriminate."

"Now run, before the guards catch up, I'll stall them. Be safe."





At this point the PC can choose what to do, provided they have ample of time to choose because of the delay the hag will cause. 

The PC can choose whether to mess around back at the market. Go Home, or go to the Yawning portal. 


Market = random shit until something else



# Returning "Home"
When arriving in the street the home is located, you see multiple buildings, including the one you call "home", destroyed. Upon closer inspection you can see that one of the public transit carriages had an accident and steered right into those buildings. Puddles of blood can be found around the carriage. 
In front of the building you call "home". You see 2 people sobbing. You do know that there lives a family of 3 in that building. You can only see the father and daughter in front of the building. 
The mom died in the accident. 

Let PC do his thing or whatever. 
Make sure he gets to the yawning portal


# The yawning portal
The PC ends up at the front door of the Yawning portal. When walking he he's greeted by Durnan. Durnan will say hello and offer them a drink. 


Just roleplay whatever and make sure the PC ends at the table. 


Go to [[The yawning portal]]

# The store

The scene starts in front of a grocery store. Bolt is told the following:

"Earlier today the yawning portal saw a new influx of adventurers that came to chill out and drink with eachother. It was so busy that the bar actually became close to running out of supplies and booze. Durnan sent you to gather some groceries and "The good stuff" so that there'd still be enough for customers to consume. You find yourself in front of a grocery story where Durnan said you'd be able to get the groceries. The good stuff however, you can get at place called Barsteiner Brewery."

When walking into the grocery store, Bolt will be greeted by the clerk and conversation will happen. When told about Durnans order he'll walk into the store and fill a basket with some supplies.

Whilst the shopkeeper is in the store 2 bandits walk into the store attempting to steal the gold from the cash drawer. They attempt to hold the shopkeeper and other 2 customers at crossbowpoint. 

Here BOLT has 3 options, the first being to not intervene and let them just take the money. The shopkeep will suggest just following orders so nobody gets hurt.
The 2nd being to kill the bandits. This causes the other customers to freak out and run out screaming. This causes some local guards to rush towards the store and try to figure out what happened, queue roleplay.
The last option is to deal with the enemies non lethally.

# Barsteiner Brewery

Upon arriving at barsteiner brewery describe the following scene.

"You arrive at the street on which barsteiner brewery is located, somewhere deep in the dock ward. The entire area feels sketchy and partly dilapidated, some buildings have open doors where workers can be seen hauling crates and fish. A couple of buildings down you see a sign reading Barsteiner Brewery."

When walking up to the brewery, you walk past an alleyway guarded by two men, both wearing a cloth rag to cover their mouths and nose. You can see a symbol on their shoulder showing a triangle. Behind them you see a group of Kenku talking with eachother and just messing about. You can see that they're not doing anything illegal or bad, but have the feeling that this is a group of no-goods.

When walking up to Barsteiner Brewery the player will be greeted by a worker there who sounds scruffy. When inquiring about the ale, the worker says he doesn't know a Durnan. The PC can do an insight check or something similar to see if he's lying. If the PC thinks he's speaking the truth, he'll be asked to pay 10gp for the good stuff. 

Either way, by either paying or exposing the worker you will receive a keg with a large barsteiner logo on it, you feel that the keg weighs a bit more then expected from a keg of booze.

After receiving the barrel you hear screaming and yelling from the alley where the kenku were, you also hear some crow sounding squaaahs. 

When turning around you see that the 2 guys blocking your entrance to the alley have walked a bit out and now don't want anyone near 

Attempting to talk or walk your way past these guys will result in combat. 

Checking in the alley what happened will lead to nothing, only finding some ruffled up feathers and blood on the ground.

# The yawning portal
Upon entering the yawning portal, [[Durnan]] will wave at BOLT happily. He'll thank him for doing the favour and tells him that a job might've come up. He'll point towards a table where BOLT can take a seat. 

BOLT can do something inside of the bar, but taking a seat will end the session. 

"As you take a seat on the table you wait for a little while, until some other people start taking a seat as well."

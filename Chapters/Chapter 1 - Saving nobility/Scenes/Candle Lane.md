"Gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeon. Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed. The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle."

You find a warehouse, with on the side a symbol of a black winged snake (symbol of the [[Zhentarim]]).
Players can recall this significance if they have ties to [[Zhentarim]] or succeed a high enough int check.


# [[Zhentarim]] hideout
![[Zhentarim hideout.png]]


The hideout is a semi-abandoned warehouse used by the [[Zhentarim]] (black network) as a hideout.

The warehouse has 3 entrances:
- A front door
- Warehouse loading door
- Painted over window (find with a good perception check)

To enter:
Normally lockpicking or strength, else whatever player comes up with thats good

If noise is made outside before entering:
Alert Kenku, making them hide behind furniture and causing a ruckus
Check passive perception (16+)



## Z1. Main room

The Black Network's main business is recruiting, training, and equipping sellswords. Crates packed with weapons, rations, boots, black uniforms, and other gear fill the warehouse.

If kenku are hidden:
"Tables and chairs have been carelessly tossed across the floor. The corpses of a dozen men lie along the walls, their rapiers and daggers lying nearby. On the north side of the area, stairs rise to an open level above."
When PC walk into Z1. Let Kenku Ambush them.

If kenku aren't hidden:
"Four short, avian creatures with long beaks and black feathers look over in surprise from where they stand in the middle of the warehouse. Each wears a hooded cloak and wields a shortsword."

## Z2. Storage closet

The storage closet is filled with a bunch of empty boxes and barrels spread everywhere. Under a tarp at the north side of the room, some faint breathing can be heard.
When the player goes to investigate, it is revealed that this person is [[Renaer Neverember]] 

[[Renaer Neverember]] is unarmed and thanks the players for rescuing him. 

When prompted, Renaer will share more information of the night:
On the night of the abduction, Renaer was concerned that Floon was too intoxicated to find his way home by himself and offered to escort him. The two were jumped by five thugs as they left Fillet Lane and headed north on Zastrow Street.
Renaer feels guilty that Floon was taken, since he believes that they mistook Floon for him.
If the characters ask Renaer to join their search for Floon, he agrees to do so, arming himself with a dagger and a rapier scavenged from the dead Zhents in the warehouse.

If a character asks Renaer why the Zhents kidnapped him, he gives the following truthful reply:
"The Zhentarim thinks that my father embezzled a large amount of gold while he was Lord, and that he hid the dragons somewhere in the city. The Zhentarim thought I knew something about this, but I don't. My father and I haven't spoken in years. During the questioning they did, they ripped off a locket of mine because it seemed important to them and quickly placed me here before grabbing Floon."

If the player's ask where Floon is:
"I have no clue. Some time after I got put in this room I heard a bunch of fighting happening outside, it sounded like Floon was getting carried away but I have no clue where. 


## Z3. Secret room
When the player goes near the door, or wants to look for "something special", roll a perception check 15. They'll spot the secret door
If door is opened, an alarm goes off at the offices above. 

When entered, present a chest with the following loot:
- 4 paintings, each worth 75gp

Nothing special make something up


## Z5. Offices 
Multiple offices with nothing of value
Above each door is a bell with some wires following the wall downward.
A character who seaches the office finds [[A paper bird]]. 
They also find an opened locket that belonged to Renear. Showing this locket to Renaer has him discover that there's a secret compartment, it's contents now being empty. 





Either when enough time has passed or when the players have finished exploring every room - Go to The watch arrives 






# The watch arrives

Around 12 city guards storm the building having received a report of suspicious activity. 
The squad is led by a guard named Hyustus [[Staget]].

The party can recognize him from [[The dock ward#Blood In the streets]] as the head officer

[[Staget]] is a stern uptight man, most people respect him. 

If kenku are alive they are put into custody and the squad can figure out what happened without the players knowlegde (zhents vs xanathar)
If the kenku are dead, the players are questioned about what happened.

[[Staget]] recognizes Renaer and tries to be on his best behaviour, even excusing the party and looking away at their crimes for now (fighting, breaking and entering).


<font style="color:orange">If Jelle [[Characters/Players/BOLT]]</font>: [[Staget]] looks at bot and inquires what he is doing with the party 
End the conversation by confirming that [[Characters/Players/BOLT]] has the up-to-date laws in his database and asks [[Characters/Players/BOLT]] to keep the party in check and not break any laws. 


### What does [[Staget]] know?

[[Staget]] can recognize the Kenku by their attire as a part of the Xanathar, he can also recognize the slain men as Zhentarim men. 

He knows that the warehouse belongs to Zhentarim and that their logo is that of a flying snake. 

///DM INFO He once had the warehouse under control in hoop to look for a Zhentarim big fish named Urstul Floxin

He can tell the players that floon was most likely taken by the [[Xanathar Guild]], he does now know where exactly

If asked, he will not help the players find / rescue Floon because he has bigger fish to catch. 



# Going to the sewers 

If the party found out from the Kenku where the Xanathar Hideout is, they can instantly go to [[The Sewers]]

The party can do an outside investigation check to find cloth remaining items of the Kenku which lead to [[The Sewers]] 

The party can do a survival check which results in tracks leading to [[The Sewers]] 

The party can ask around the dock ward where upon a succesful charisma check or bribe results in them being led to [[The Sewers]]

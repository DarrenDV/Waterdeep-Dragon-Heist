## Intro

This starts at the entrance of [[The Yawning portal - location]] 

When the party enters the bar they are greeted by [[Durnan]] [[The Yawning portal - location#Durnan]]
He tells the party to take seat at an empty table and chair when he has the chance.

Go to the brawl

ELSE

If the party keeps being busy, go to brawl when enough time has passed.





## Tavern Brawl 

Give players a description of the current ambiance of the bar something akin to:

"You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over."

Make sure this conforms to their situation.

Follow it up with the start of the brawl:

"Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?" Then a seven-foot-tall halforc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump Into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure- but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?"



All enemies are bandits, make something up stat wise because it's possibly the first encounter
Let them roleplay it out, combat and all. 

Their leader can be identified as [[Krentz]]

```statblock
monster: Bandit
```




### Getting involved

If they want to fight roll initiative
By the time they arrive is [[Krentz]] at 3hp and attempts to run away.
Pulling Yagra away from [[Krentz]] requires a contested strength check
She will thank if they help her

Take note if [[Krentz]] survived for later encounter


If the combat goes on too long (3 rounds) go to Troll and friends


### Hanging back

If they don't get involved Yagra knocks Krentz unconcious before being knocked unconcious by the other bandits. After which they run away carrying Kentz. 





## Troll and friends

Either during combat if it took to long, or afterwards a panic ensues:

"Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom, a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, [[Durnan]], who shouts, "Troll!""

Most patrons take cover and hide

The troll has 44hp

When the players have the chance to do something, the troll and stirges have emerged, everyone rolls initiative. Including 3 stirges, the others fly down. 


[[Durnan]] goes first, grabbing the sword from under the counter and jumping towards the troll. 
As he attacks he calls on the players to focus dealing with the stirges first before helping with the troll. 
Yagra joins if she is still consious

If anyone reaches 0 hp during this fight, they are stabalized by employees.



```statblock
monster: Stirge
```

TROLL HAS 23 HP
```statblock
monster: Troll
```

When the troll has been defeated, everyone cheers. [[Durnan]] personally comes to thank the adventurers who helped and will clear their tab this time. 






## Meeting [[Volo]] 

Once the troll has been dealt with, allow the players to rp for a little while

Then after sometime Volo goes to the characters and introduces himself

He says: "You be adventurers, am I right? I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?"

When the table has been reached -> introduction:
The figure who approached you strokes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. "Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city this past period. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have lost a friend amid this odious malevolence. "My friend's name is [[Floon]] Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, Last night he accompanied me to the Skewered Dragon, a dark, bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward. I called it an early night, but Floon remained â€“ drinking and merrymaking. His wife tracked me down earlier today and told me Floon never returned home. 


When accepted, he gives everyone 10gold

Characters who want to discover his intentions must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, a character discerns that Volo is honest but might be stretching the truth about how much he can pay. (Currently low on cash, Volo is awaiting royalty payments from Volo's Guide to Monsters. To make more coin. he began work on a new book, Vo/o's Guide to Spirits and Specters. As it happens, his knowledge of spirits mostly concerns the alcoholic variety, and the writing has not been going well.)

If pressed, Volo urges the characters to trust him, and promises he'll have the rest of the reward, 100 gp per character, ready to deliver once [[Floon]] is returned to him alive.


### Info that is available
#### What does [[floon]] look like?
a handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was dressed in princely garb when Volo last saw him.

#### Where was he last seen?
Last night, before [[Floon]] disappeared, he and Volo were drinking and merrymaking at the Skewered Dragon, a dark, bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward. Volo recommends that the characters start their search there.




After this the characters can start their journey or keep messing around in the bar. 

Go to [[The dock ward]]

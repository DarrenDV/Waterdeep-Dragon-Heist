The PC's return to the church where they are quicky met by the high inquisitor with a concerned look on his face.

"Hello cedric and his wayward simpletons, we could use your help."
"In the process of looking into this cult of HC we stumbled upon one of their hideouts, a small shack in the backyard of an house with a hidden basement underneath. 
We cleared it out and rescued some captured people but interestingly enough they were not from here but overseas.
Whilst we didn't learn anything new about the cult we did find out that the capturees were supposed to be brought to a warehouse in the dock ward. 
A couple days later, a smaller church was raided by what we presume were the cult. 
They managed to snag an item that would've been really helpful against them. 
We think that they'll be going after us more now that they've weakened our defenses. 
We believe that they're storing our weapon in the same warehouse they wanted to send they capturees to. 
Please find and retrieve our weapon. If you're able to do so you'll have proven more than worthy to wield it yourself."

"I might have something that could aid you in your mission. We obtained a dozen cultist outfits from our raid so you might be able to infiltrate the building yourself. Use them however you'd like."

If the party infiltrates the warehouse disguised as cultists they are accepted and let in, but will be suspicious if they act weird. At some point the cultists will sacrifice one of the humans to summon an demon. If the party is hostile at that point this process will be started instantaniously
It takes around 2-3 turns for the demon to be summoned --howler--

"Elder V, I'm happy to announce we've recently acquired the shipment of sacrifices from the east, for now we'll keep most of them save. Due to the increasing number of prying eyes from the church we'll sacrifice one of them for an increase in force. The other will be shipped to the auction for trading as you've requested. Together with that bow from the church, they should provide plenty of dragons. However we've already sent that one out for inspection by the organizers. Attached are the shipping labels to be cleared at the action for the rest of the prisoners.

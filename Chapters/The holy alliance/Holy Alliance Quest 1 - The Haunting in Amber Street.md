# Amber street
The PC start at the south of the street

Amber street is a street located in the southern ward. Whilst lower-middle class citizens live there, the buildings look quite nice and taken care of.
The street has some citizens walking around, what you would expect from a street like this off the main road.

The section the players find themselves in is around 16 houses, with 8 on either side. The houses are divided with odd numbers on the left side and even on the right. The house that is haunted is #30.

**Tier 1 - Locals Living Farthest Away:**

1. **Uncertainty:** These residents acknowledge that they've heard some rumors but consider the disturbances to be mere exaggerations or a product of superstitious minds.
2. **Skeptical Perspective:** They mention that the stories about the haunted house have circulated for years, and every few years, someone tries to investigate and find nothing.
3. **Folklore:** Some of these locals might share local folklore or legends about the house but regard them as little more than stories to spook children.
4. **Minimal Experiences:** They may mention that they've heard strange sounds at night but attribute them to animals or the natural settling of the old house.
5. **Friendly Advice:** They suggest focusing on other matters, like more pressing issues in the neighborhood, and imply that the haunted house is a mere distraction.

**Tier 2 - Locals Living Moderately Close:**

1. **Curiosity:** These residents show a bit more interest in the situation and express mild concern about the house's history.
2. **Previous Incidents:** They recall anecdotes from the past where someone tried to spend a night in the house but left with no concrete evidence of hauntings.
3. **Sympathetic Stories:** Some have heard stories from their neighbors about eerie sounds or sightings, but these incidents are not well-documented or substantiated.
4. **Suspicion:** They suggest that there might be an explanation, such as pranksters or vandals who sneak around the house at night.
5. **Superstitions:** They mention local superstitions like avoiding the house's garden or not walking on the street directly in front of it, but these are often shrugged off as coincidences.

**Tier 3 - Locals Living Next Door:**

1. **Fearful Residents:** These individuals have witnessed or experienced strange phenomena firsthand and live in constant fear.
2. **Detailed Accounts:** They can provide detailed accounts of eerie events, such as apparitions, flickering lights, or disembodied voices, particularly during the night.
3. **Local History:** They know a great deal about the house's dark past, including stories of a noble family that suffered a curse due to their association with a sinister cult.
4. **Reluctant Witnesses:** Some have tried to document the disturbances but are too frightened to spend significant time near the house to gather concrete evidence.
5. **Desperation:** They express a deep desire to rid the neighborhood of the malevolent presence and are eager to assist in any investigation or cleansing efforts.


All locals can rp whatever. Roll a d8 per local questioned


**Roll a D8 for Misinformation (Misdirected Information on Amber Street):**

1. **Wrong House:** The local points you to the wrong house on Amber Street, claiming that a different one is the source of the hauntings, leading to a confusing situation.
2. **Friendly Spirits:** They insist that the disturbances are the work of benevolent spirits on Amber Street, not realizing the malevolent presence in the specific house.
3. **Local Pranks:** The resident thinks that the disturbances are local children playing pranks on residents, but they mistakenly attribute these pranks to the entire street.
4. **Skeptic's Perspective:** They argue that the neighborhood's reputation for hauntings is mere superstition, attributing it to the entire area rather than the specific house.
5. **Historical Misdirection:** The local provides fabricated historical accounts of different houses on Amber Street, falsely connecting them to the hauntings.
6. **Mistaken Identity:** They confuse the haunted house with another on Amber Street, erroneously sending the party to the wrong location.
7. **Animal Sounds:** They believe that the unsettling noises are caused by animals in the entire area of Amber Street, failing to pinpoint the source in the targeted house.
8. **Friendly Neighbors:** They suggest that all the neighbors on Amber Street are friendly and welcoming, not realizing the true nature of the haunted house.



House #30 will always deny that there is a haunting to begin with, and even if there is it's probably on the opposite end of the street. 


When interacting with the occupant of house #30, they'll notice nothing except for cedric, who has an odd feeling about the occupant. 
Upon closer inspection, the occupant of the house seems strange, their eyes, hollow, as if they're a husk of a person. Upon noticing this, this odd feeling grows stronger. Something is near. 

"Will that be all gentlemen? The occupant says, before shutting the door shut in front of you."

Give room for RP.



# Entering the house 
The goal of the party at this point is to enter the house and discover what the hell is going on. 

The entire house can be explored, but the basement is the hotspot. The occupant has retreated back to the basement. 

The house looks normal, and has a typically decorated interior. The only key difference is that a thick layer of dust has coated everything. 
While exploring the house, the party may encounter minor supernatural occurrences, such as doors slamming shut by themselves, whispers from empty rooms, and ethereal figures glimpsed in the corner of their eyes. These manifestations heighten the suspense and reinforce the haunted nature of the place.


"As you descend the creaking wooden stairs, a musty, cold draft envelopes you. You find yourself in a dimly lit and cramped basement, its walls constructed of old, moss-covered stone. A mixture of earthy scents, dampness, and the faint, unsettling scent of incense pervades the air."

The basement is adorned with unsettling symbols painted in a dark crimson hue on the walls, floor, and even the ceiling. These symbols appear to be related to a malevolent cult, intricate and foreboding, indicating their presence and dark practices.
The primary source of illumination is a circle of blood-red candles that surround a central altar. Their flickering flames cast eerie, dancing shadows across the room, adding to the unsettling atmosphere. The candles are almost burned down to their stubs, hinting at recent activity.
In the center of the basement stands a stone altar, covered in black cloth. Upon it lies sinister tools like daggers, chalices, and small, metallic figurines. The altar seems to have been used for dark rituals and, perhaps, even sacrifices. There are dried stains of an unidentifiable, dark substance on the altar's surface.

In the far corner of the basement, you notice a terrified and disheveled figure. It's a kidnapped victim, bound by restraints to the wall, with a cloth gag over their mouth. Their wide, fearful eyes beg for help. They're malnourished and in desperate need of rescue.

The basement is exceptionally quiet, save for the occasional drip of water and the soft whispering of the candles. It feels as if the very walls themselves are holding their breath, as if the room is aware of the malevolence that has transpired within its confines.


Near the far corner of the basement in which the victim is present a small desk is located with some candles and a stack of paper on top of them. 

In  the north of the room, a medium sized closet is indented into the wall. When walking down the stairs it lets out an occasional thump. When a pc walks onto the ritual circle in the middle of the room, the candles start to glow bright and the closet slams open, revealing a chain devil inside.

monster: Chain Devil

##### The kidnapped victim 
The kidnapped victim can reveal herself to be wife of the huskless man with whom she lived in the house. She doesn't know what came over him but he started acting weird after their daughter went missing a month ago.


##### The closet 
Inside of the closet lies the corpse of the man they talked to at the front door. He is dead. 


##### The desk
The desk contains some paperwork. Among the paperwork are instructions for how to summon a devil and a note. The note reads:

"
_To the Owner of This House,_

_Your daughter's safety is in our hands, and her fate depends on your compliance. We, the Cult of HC, demand that you follow our instructions to the letter, without hesitation. Failure to do so will result in harm to your beloved child._

_You must prepare the basement for a demonic circle of summoning. Follow the diagram enclosed with this letter. At the next full moon, begin the ritual as instructed, and complete it within the hour. Any deviation from our instructions will result in consequences for your daughter._

_Follow our guidance, and your daughter will remain unharmed. Refuse, and you will bear the guilt of her suffering._

_The Cult of HC_
"

On the day of the auction, the party receives a note from the priest giving them some words of encouragement and a little help.

	Dear Cedric & cohorts,
	Tonight you'll be going to the auction the cult of HC is attending. We've done some scouting of the property and it seems that it is most likely an underground or basement level auction. The address noted on the shipping forms lead to a laundromat situated in the Field Ward. Some of our agents have been able to take a look at the invitations and have made a forgery of one for you to use to gain entry. 
	
	Your mission will be to infiltrate the auction, retrieve what was stolen from us and find out what you can about the cult of HC. If they're selling stuff there there's bound to be some address where there money should go. In order to aid you in your mission I've managed to empty our coffers a bit to make you look the part of an auction attendee. In the attached pouch you will find 1500gpn and the forged invitation. You are allowed to use this money for the auction only and it would be appreciated if you could return any unused dragon. 
	
	We have no intel on who else is attending the auction so be careful and good luck!
	

## Laundromat
The party arrives at the laundromat, they are able to clearly see inside of the laundromat. Numerous contraptions, looking like iron and copper tonnes, are whirring around with water slushing inside of them. In the back of the store an older gentleman is reading the paper. 

By showing the invite to the gentleman he'll wave them to the back. He wont follow them but does close the door behind them.

Following the stairs behind the door they arrive at a security stop with a guard next to it. He asks the party for their invite and upon seeing it gives 2 knocks on the door which gets opened by a guard behind it. 


## Auction 
#### Entry hall
Walking past the security point the players find themselves in the lobby, with numerous masked attendees talking to each other. The party gets waved to the counter by a worker.

"Welcome, please hand in your coat and any weapons. Seeing as to how you're not wearing masks you're probably new here, so please wear these." He hands the party some masks. "Here is your bidding sign, you're number 078, good luck."

#### Main auction hall
A bunch of masked people are standing around in the auction hall. On the main stage a presenter is talking with some staff but seems about to be ready.

From what the players can see when entering the main action hall, there is a door to their left with a sign reading purchase counter, a door to their right with an emergency exit sign above and 2 doors on the main stage, presumably for carrying stuff on and off stage. 

After some time the presenter shoos his staff away and starts the show. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to todays auction. I'm sure you've been waiting for quite some time on it because of the high ticket items we have tonight. Tonight we have a total of 23 items which are all up for sale. Before we begin please do note that we follow a strict you win you buy policy and that any meddling will not be tolerated. Lastly I want to give a huge thanks to some of tonight's sponsor, the Cult of HC."

"Let's start the show with our first item" - [[Auction items and starting prices]] 
Encourage players to do stuff during the auction
After the auction, make it last some time. 
"Thank you everyone for participating in todays auction, for the winners of our items, please go to the purchase counter if you havent already. And to everyone else, have a good night!"



## Backrooms
#### The purchase counter
The purchase counter holds 2 cashiers which handle the money transactions of the casino, items bought can either be discreetly shipped to the customers property or taken directly at time of purchase, depending on item size. Bought items are stored in the storage room connected via the back. High value items need to be retrieved from the office for security measures. 

#### Purchase storage room 
The purchase storage room is in between the warehouse and purchase counter. Every item bought at the action is stored in this room, except for high value items. Items bought in the auction are brought into the room instantly. 

#### Office 
The office is where the organizer works and where customer relations are held. Expensive transactions are handled from within this room. 
The organizer is a stern person but he does follow the coin is king rule, he can be bribed quite effectively.
Due to the nature of the importance and transactions handled within the room, the room holds documents for key customers such as the [[Cassalanters]]

Customer files fill a shelf, whilst none feel so important as the one labeled Cult of HC. 
Most of the customer information lines in this file are empty, the address line however is filled in. Pointing towards Cassalanter Villa in the sea ward.

The office also has a chest containing 300gp

The office connects to the locked vault room


#### Locked vault room
The locked vault room is guarded by 2 thugs, and the door itself is locked by a magic spell, only unlockable by the organizer. No-one knows of this however.

#### Warehouse 
The warehouse contains every item from the [[Auction items and starting prices]] list and some more random stuff. A total of 200gp in a crate can be found. The warehouse has a back entry that goes to a ramp connected to the street.

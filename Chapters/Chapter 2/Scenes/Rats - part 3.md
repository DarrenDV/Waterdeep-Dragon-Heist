# Into the sewers


## Mouse trap

"After entering the sewers you are making your way toward the hideout of the Rat King. Nearing the location, you find something on your way. In front of you you something shiny sticking out of the dark sludge resting in the sewers. Thanks to your darkvision, you can point it out as a bag of gold reflecting the little light there is. What do you do?"

Mouse Trap 
A giant mouse trap lurks under the muck, with the coin bag placed as bait on its triggering mechanism. 

Detection and Disabling. Characters who search around the bag discover the presence of a large, submerged object with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Once detected, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check deduces that removing the bag sets off a giant mouse trap. 

The mechanism can be jammed, or the bag swapped for an object of equal weight, with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. 

Trigger. 
Taking the bait releases a metal bar hidden under the sludge, which snaps forward loudly and strikes anyone standing within 5 feet of the trap. Effect. All targets in range of the trap when it triggers must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success. 
Characters who fail the check are restrained by the iron bar, taking an additional 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of their turns until they are freed. As an action, a creature can attempt a DC 12 Strength check to free itself or another creature pinned under the bar.

The cloth bag is worth 50gp if grabbed.

## The rat kings lair

"Rounding the corner, you enter a large drain at the intersection of many sewer tunnels. In the center of the chamber, atop a throne made of discarded junk, you see a woman draped in a thin black veil. Hundreds of rats envelop her lower body, nuzzling against her protectively."

A perception check reveals the following information:
From under her veil you can determine a few details, she seems to be sobbing, some red hair is poking out from under her veil, and her attention is on the rats, not on you. 

The pc's can either talk it out or fight it out. 
If the characters approach tactfully, a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check convinces her to parlay (see ‘Talk It Out’). 
Good roleplaying should reward advantage on this check. 
Mentioning the Rat King’s romance with the Lady of Plagues ensures she talks willingly.
Failing this results in combat. 


### Fight it out
If she hasn’t already informed them about the attack on the Salvation Parade (see [[Rats - part 3#Talk it out]] ), she does so when she’s defeated, vengefully laughing that it’s too late to stop her rival’s attack.
She starts with herself and 1 swarm of rats

### Talk it out

Catarina “Cat” Brisby is a brooding woman with a chip on her shoulder. Having grown up teased for her fascination with rodents, Cat is used to being an outcast; slow to trust, fast to take offense, and often abrupt in her mannerisms. She’s completely unequipped to handle her emotions regarding the Lady of Plagues and the loss of her father.


If convinced to talk, the Rat King shares the following information: 
• Have the people forgotten how kind the Rat King has been to them, keeping the Xanathar’s goons in check here at the Docks? 
• Now the Rat King’s father, Captain Brisby, has been murdered, and the Rat King framed for the crime. Death by rats? An insult! The Lady of Plagues will pay! 
• The Rat King knows that the Lady of Plagues is responsible for the Rat Pox and her father’s murder. How? None of your business. 
• The Lady of Plagues plans to unleash a new strain of her virus on the Salvation Parade. The Rat King sent her minions to ambush and stop her. If the characters want to help, they should join them. Hurry! The parade is about to start!

If the characters bring up the Rat King’s secret relationship with the Lady of Plagues, she tells them more: 
• Yes, well, the Rat King was enamored with the Lady of Plagues once. A kindred soul, yet so misguided. So beautiful. 
• The Lady of Plagues came to Waterdeep to cull the city with plague: to “strengthen the stock”, she’d said. The Rat King persuaded her to hold back. Wouldn’t the common cold do instead? 
• In time, the Rat King trusted the Lady of Plagues enough to share her own secrets: her true name, Catarina “Cat” Brisby, and her only relative, her father Captain Brisby. There’s no point keeping such secrets now… 
• After the Rat King confided in the Lady of Plagues, the sickness took hold in the Dock Ward, and before long her father was found dead. Is she supposed to believe that’s a coincidence? No, it was a betrayal.




### A rat among rats
If the characters show the Rat King the unfinished advertisement from the secret laboratory, or the letter from Brisby’s strongbox, a misshapen rat scurries from the swarm and begins to panic and run around. 
Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes it as a cranium rat: a telepathic rodent that often gathers in swarms to spy for the mind flayers.

The Rat King is genuinely disgusted to see it in her swarm and asks the characters to help her catch it. Each character can take a single action to stop the rat before it flees into the sewers. If caught, the cranium rat begs telepathically for its life in exchange for information. Even if slain, it sends the following images to one of the characters before it dies:



"
Several images flash through your mind in an instant! 

First, you see the cranium rat nestled in the arms of the mind flayer as it stands before the Xanathar crime lord. 
“We can transport the slaves, Xanathar. We just need the proper distraction to keep the City Watch busy. How about that old enemy of yours, the Rat King?” 

Then you see the cranium rat hiding amidst a rat swarm, spying on the Rat King and the Lady of Plagues as they hold hands inside a laboratory. With great care, the Lady of Plagues locks a vial of green gas inside her strongbox. 

Next, you see the Rat King introducing the Lady of Plagues to her father, Captain Brisby. As the trio sit down for a meal in Brisby’s apartment, you see the cranium rat spying on them through the window. 

Then you see the mind flayer standing in front of the Xanathar again. “Unleashing her plague will create the distraction we need. After that, all we need do is turn them against each other…” 

Finally, you see a swarm of cranium rats pouring through a window to attack Captain Brisby!
"




The characters now know that the Xanathar has been playing the Rat King and the Lady of Plagues against each other. If anything seems unclear, the Rat King can fill in the blanks for them (refer to the “Background” section for details). 
If the characters question the cranium rat about the Xanathar’s motives, they learn that the crime boss plans to smuggle a shipment of slaves down Cloak Lane soon after the Salvation Parade. 

__Regardless, and assuming she’s still alive, the Rat King rushes above ground to stop her lover from unleashing the disease!__


### Rewards 
The Rat King carries [[pipes of the sewers]], which she offers as thanks if characters help reveal the truth. 
She also carries 5 healing potions. 







# The salvation parade
"You return to the streets of the dock ward QZ and find that the parade is in full swing. Crowds of priests fill the streets, handing out blankets and care baskets to the Rat-Pox afflicted citizens along the curb. Everyone is talking and despite the situation the atmosphere seems hopeful."

When you're still taking in the situation, you hear startled shrieks coming from further down the crowd. Above them, a woman in a beaked masks stands on the edge of a balcony with 3 cultists standing around her. 

She screams:
"How quick the Rat King was to blame the Lady of Plagues for her own misfortune! Quick to blame, to label, to put her in a box. Now her people will suffer for her presumptions!"


If not persuaded, the lady of plagues will initiate combat. But she can share the following information if the characters want to talk:
- The Lady of Plagues was betrayed by the Dock Ward’s precious protector, the Rat King; the only other person who knew about her “masterpiece”. She thinks the Rat King released her disease against her will and framed her.
- Yes, the Lady of Plagues created the disease, but she’s an “artiste,” not a mass murderer. It’s designed to turn people into rats, but it seems it hasn’t done so yet. What a disappointment! This new strain won’t prove so ineffective.


If the characters found all the clues and uncovered the Xanathar’s plot, the presence of the Rat King stops the Lady of Plagues from attacking. Go to Result
If not, three swarms of rats emerge from hiding to face the Lady of Plagues and her followers.

# Foil the Xanathar

If they’re alive, the Lady of Plagues and the Rat King gladly join the characters.

Arriving at Cloak Lane, the character with the highest passive Perception notices a line of tied and gagged humanoids being led quietly through shadows by the Xanathar’s goons: 
2 apprentice wizards, four guards and two thugs. 

```statblock
monster: Guard
```
```statblock
monster: Thug
```
![[Apprentice Wizard.png]]


The criminals fight to the death to carry out their mission.




Once killed the PC's can free the slaves, let them RP that out. 

They can find 200gp in loose valuables on the [[Xanathar Guild]] members. 



After the battle, everyone will celebrate their success, and slaves are thankful to the party for saving them. 



The lady of plagues will turn to the party, having something to say:
"First thing first, I think apologies are in order. Threatening the entire city wasn't really the best thing to do, especially after now knowing the entire situation and letting my emotions take a toll on me. Here are some vials for a cure for the poison that was released here by Xanathar. Whilst it isn't enough for everyone, it's quite easily replicateable if you bring it to the right people. Regarding your friend, I don't have a cure nor am I able to make one right now. I'm missing some quite rare ingredients for a cure and am not going to retrieve them myself, I wouldn't even know where to look except for a rumor."

If inquired about the rumor, she has the following to say:
"Rumor says that there's an old alchemists a few days travel out of town. It was said he was quite powerful and spent his time brewing some nasty concoctions. He's apparantly been missing for quite some time. If you want, I mark the tower on a map for you. If you do end up going, you could bring the ingredients to me and I'll brew a cure. It's the least I could do." 
This leads to [[The Saving of Stickey Mickey]] 



After this they did everything they could. The Rat King and Lady of plagues will go back to do their thing. 
PC's can go end the quest by talking to captain staget back at WDCW HQ. [[Return to WDCW HQ]]

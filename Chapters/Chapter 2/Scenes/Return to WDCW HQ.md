Upon returning to WDCW HQ, the players can find that the Force Gray wing, while still tense, is a lot calmer. When walking into the wing, Staget will call the players to his office in a happy yell. 

"Word spreads around fast, 5 random's that saved the citizens of the dock ward and possibly the entirety of waterdeep from a disease."

Either:
"Those characters sure were weird. Whilst it is unfortunate that The Rat King needed to be killed, I'm sure someone new will fill the role. Regarding The Lady of Plagues, it's good that you guys managed to end her, who knows what kind of destruction she could've caused."

Or:
"Not only did you manage to stop the disease from spreading, you uncovered a lovers quarrel and found out that Xanathar was behind it all. On top of that you stopped them in their tracks and saved their capturees."


"You have done well for the city and as a thanks, I do have something to give back to you all."

- An invitation to [[Force Gray]], "You've been invited to join force gray as special operatives. If you accept to join, you'll be requested to do some work that bureaucracy can't wait on. You'll essentially join our SOD (special operating division)."
	- Some perks include:
		- Increasing guild ranking as you complete more assignments
		- Special gear when nessecary
		- A possible way to have judge look the other way on certain crimes
		- A [[Badge of the watch]], one for everyone
- 300gp.
- 3 healing potions

At this point the PC's also level up to level 3.

Let PC's roleplay but do let them know that at this point they can return to [[Locations/Trollskull Manor|Trollskull Manor]]

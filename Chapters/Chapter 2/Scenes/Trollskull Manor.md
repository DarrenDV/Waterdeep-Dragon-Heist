## The three Urchins

Upon first entering [[Locations/Trollskull Manor]], the players will see 3 children playing inside of the building, these are [[The three Urchins]]. 
The players will encounter them playing around pretending to be fighting trolls and goblins.

When talked to, they'll introduce themselves to the party and inquire what there doing there.
When given awnsers, they can realise the party consists of adventurers and gawk in amazement.
They'll ask if they can join the PC's party and be visibly saddened if denied. 

When prompted, they'll can provide the following info:
* The building has not been inhabited for as long as they remember
* Their parents are as provided in [[The three Urchins#Relations]] 
* They know of Lif but don't know what he wants / how to deal with him


They'll attempt to stick around and follow the party whenever possible, within Trollskull manor and wherever in the city. 


At this point they can be randomly conversed with or the party can opt to explore trollskull manor / alley





## Durnan is back
After the party has spent some time exploring / talking with everyone [[Durnan]] will show up to Trollskull Manor requesting to speak to the party. 

Durnan will take a look around the place saying something akin to "This place has become a shithole"

After greetings and some smalltalk he'll state his purpose for showing up. 

"I heard you guys got this dump. As you might have known, this used to be a tavern, a pretty popular one at that."

Let him remark on the dirty tables broken dishes etc. 

"I'm a representative of the tavernkeepers guild, also knows as the fellowship of inkeepers. And we want to invite you guys to open this place back up"
"You'll be running you own tavern."
"You could decide to not open up, but I don't think your neighbours will think highly of someone keeping it a dump"
"The guild will help you getting started, we'll just need an up-front payment and some time and this place will look fine as can be again. After this you'll be required to make membership payments to the guild."
"It'll cost you about 1250 gold up front and around 60-100 every tenday"
"The guild is willing to offer you a 1000 gold loan but you'll need to pay it back when renovation has finished."


If the party chooses to proceed with renovating trollskull manor, the bottom floor will be closed off starting the next day, opening up after a large faction quest (such as rats) or after enough time has passed. 

Before leaving Durnan will have one last question for the party:

"So.... What are you guys naming it?"

Let them answer it.


Durnan will happily say thanks to the party if they buy and then leave. 

Else he'll say that he hopes the party reconsiders and that they'll know where to find him. 



After this the party can keep exploring or end the night here, resulting in a long rest. 









## A request for help
When the players move outside, they'll notice that they received some mail in their mailbox.

Opening the letter, it reads:

"Dear adventurers, I just got wind of your actions through [[Renaer Neverember]], a mutual friend of ours. He told me about what you did to save him and his friend [[Floon]]. The city is facing trouble and due to restrictions, we can't act ourselves. If you'd be willing to help us resolve this crisis, you'd be rewarded handsomely. You can visit my office at WDCW headquarters, tell reception [[Staget]]  sent you. -[[Staget]]"

Any waterdavian pc can tell that WDCW stands for Waterdeep City Watch.


At this point the PC's can do whatever they want, but the obvious thing would be to check this clue out
If they want to go for this next point, go to [[WDCW HQ]]

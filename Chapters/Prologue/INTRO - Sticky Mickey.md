Mickey learns "dangerous" places in the sewer and the no-go path > to skullport


# Returning home
The scene starts with Mickey at the entrance of a sewer subsection.

"After a day of wandering about looking for supplies and were planning on going home. You find yourself back at the subsection of the sewers you and some homeless vagrants call home. In front of you, you see two homeless men inhaling and exhaling quickly as if they just ran a mile. A look on their face suggests that they're panicked. They continuously look around them but fixate mostly towards the direction where your hideout lies."

### Talking with the homeless
PC can attempt to talk to the homeless

What do they know:
* A thug came up and told them to pack up "for business"
* Their friend refused and got killed on the spot instantly, they quickly ran
* There was only one thug, he could be dealt with

They'll ask the PC if they can maybe drive them back so they can all just live in peace and quiet. 


### Going to your home
Walking forward into the sewer you find yourself at a crossing. The only thing you know is that your way "home" is forward.

Arriving in your "street" you see a familiar sight, couple of rooms to your right which used to house sewer maintenance supplies, which were promptly moved out of the room and into the large open space to the left. That open space has a ladder which leads to a sewer manhole outside.

You however do see something large on the ground, whilst it is dark, you can slowly start seeing it laying on the ground as your darkvision gains control. You finally see the large shape appears to be a human, lying lifeless. 


Upon closer inspection you can see that the human's neck is gushing out blood from a large stabwound, no dagger could have made a holy large enough for a wound like this.  

Roll perception, high enough > you hear some noise coming from one of the rooms to your right, the room in which you sleep. 

Any way the player walks leads to [[INTRO - Sticky Mickey#Trouble arises]] 

The player can also choose to fight  / interact with the bandit, interaction leads to fighting. 

When the player sees the bandit you don't see anything special, but you do see something that looks like a yellow insignia of an circle with 10 spokes coming out of its circumference. He's a [[Xanathar Guild]] member. Mickey does recognize the logo because he has seen it multiple times in his days in the sewers. Also a dog

When dealing the final blow to the bandit he lets out a final yelp, alerting his friends nearby. 


# Trouble arises
If Mickey didn't interact with the bad guys let them casually walk in. 

From the north and ladder in the large space quickly enter around 5 Xanathar guild members, some bandits and some kenku. Definitely too many to handle. Right now it's fight or flight and fight will definitely not end well. 

Running back towards the intersection mickey will see more guild members walking up from the east and south. Behind the southern enemies lie the dead corpses of the 2 homeless guys from earlier. 

Running towards the south mickey will come across another intersection, whatever way he ends up does not matter. 

Mickey can keep walking into a tunnel, getting increasingly more cornered and trapped as time goes on. 


# Seeking refuge
Until he finds a door. 

A quick glance at the door reveals a name "Barsteiner Brewery". The door is unlocked. You can lock it from within.

Walking into the room you can see that it is full of barrels and smaller kegs. Some of which have an open lid. You can also see some stairs leading to an upper door. This one is locked however and has no small opening to slide through. 

Mickey will have to quickly make a choice.
I can hint that hiding is a good option. 

When hiding in a barrel, the lid closes shut accidentally. You hear people entering the room and talking with each other, leaving after some time. Trying to open the barrel back results in nothing, it's shut tight. 

KEG: After some time you hear someone enter the room, carrying you up and moving around a lot. You have no choice but to see where you end up. 

BARREL: After some time you hear someone enter the room, carrying you up and moving around a lot. You all of the sudden get sucked out of the barrel and are moving in a bunch of pipes. The pressure is too much to do anything. You end up in a smaller container than the barrel. You feel the container getting lifted up and moved around a lot. You have no choice but to see where you end up.

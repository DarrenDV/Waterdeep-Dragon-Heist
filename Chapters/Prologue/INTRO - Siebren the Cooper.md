# Down on your luck

"You find yourself standing in front one of Waterdeep's library and arcane research centers, having just been sent out by a lead researcher for wanting to do dangerous research. But before he can even decide what to do or where to go next, he is approached by two men."

The man can be seen wearing some rugged clothing and a hood, but most importantly can be seen wearing an emblem of a snake with wings. 

"Got kicked out eh."
"They're afraid of everything experimental. Those cowards."

"You should come with us."
"Let's talk more privately about this, we don't want any prying eyes following us."


They want to bring Siebren into a nearby alley to discuss further. 
Siebren can go willingly or forcefully. 

If going forcefully, siebren is dragged using a high enough contested strength throw.


### In the alley
The PC will be questioned in the alley regarding the research he was barred from doing. 

At any point combat can ensue

"So... What is it, this research of yours."

If by any means the PC spills the beans the thugs will act really pleasantly suprised. 

"Hand it over, your research. Our boss would really like to have this. NOW.... please...."


The enemies won't go until they've obtained siebrens research notes. Siebren here has a choice to either hand over his research, creating a retrieval arc or not giving it away, resulting in combat.

Upon beating both bandits, they can either be interrogated or have a piece of paper with the following information. 

"Do whatever you can to get leverage over him, anything experimental is fine."



If the PC does not roll to check them out, make the following shit up:

"Let me roll.... What's your passive perception? I rolled lower. 
You hear a sound coming from above, looking at it, you see what looks like a flying snake flying away."

This snake has a lower initiative count than Siebren, and siebren has 1 turn to defeat or restrain the flying snake, the snake's only goal is to fly away. If it flew away, leave it at that. This will mean the [[Zhentarim]] know about Siebrens Research and he has become a target.

# An opportunity arises 

Shortly after all of this occuring, a young wizard runs towards you in the alley. He stops by you asking for help in dealing with thugs. When he explains the situation, it sounds exactly like what siebren endured.

His name is **Corwin Frostcloak** 

"I work here on some magical research. But when I went out for lunch, 2 ruffians approached me trying to steal my research papers. Luckily I left them inside but they didn't believe me and started threatening me. I ran but they ran after me. Please help". 

Regardless of whether Siebren wants to help, two Zhentarim bandits run into the alleyway, wearing the same garb as the ones that meddled with siebren.  
They'll look in shock at the dead or unconscious agents and no words can stop them from wanting to combat Siebren. 

"What did you do to Floris & Jelle?!" They proclaim.

Here let Siebren do something, can be whatever. Else roll Initiative. 


Corwin stats:

Once defeated, Corwin will thank Siebren for the help.

"Thanks for helping me deal with these baboons, I would've been minced meat otherwise haha."

Corwin will ask here why Siebren was also approached by the Zhentarim agents. 

If siebren does tell him Corwin will say that he knows some people who might be able to help Siebren out if he wants to. If siebren accepts this Corwin will let him know "they" will be in touch but rather be anonymous for now. 
Else "If you ever decide to want to open up about it, be sure to do so when we see again. I have a feeling our paths will cross again. "


Corwin will ask siebren what he's planning on doing now.

Regardless of what he says he'll say this. 

"I don't have anything to give to you, I'm quite poor. But as a token of gratuity I want you to have this."

He hands Siebren a piece of paper.

"Its a coupon for the yawning portal, pretty famous spot. I personally really like their beer."


Try to let the conversation end. 
Let Corwin go back to the research station to discuss with his teachers about what happened. 


Siebren can do whatever now, but he'll go to the Yawning portal eventually.





# The yawning portal
When arriving in the yawning portal the PC is greeted by Durnan. 

The advertisment can lead to the following line:

"Oh looking for some good work are you, you can take a seat at that table over there." 
He points to a table with CURRENT PEOPLE sitting at it.

He is also entitled to some free food.

The PC can do anything but sitting at the table ends the session. 

"You take a seat at the table and wait, until the rest of the seats get filled."
"You take the last seat at the table and wait, until someone approaches."

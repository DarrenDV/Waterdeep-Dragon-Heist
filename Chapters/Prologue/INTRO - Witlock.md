# A strange encounter
"You have been travelling to waterdeep for quite some time. The road has mostly been lonely, but after travelling for around a tenday, you find yourself just a couple hours away from waterdeep. You're following the road and are heading around a corner when you see an abandoned carriage about 50 metres in front of you. What do you do?"

Possible check for people around, perception

When walking toward the carriage, you can see that the carriage has in fact not been abandoned. You can see what looks like a horses silhouette appearing on the other side of the carriage with multiple arrows sticking out of it's body. 

Possible check for people around, perception

When walking even closer you can see corpses of humans, presumably adventurers. Lying dead around the cart. The moment the pc sees these adventurers, an arrow flies right beside his head and two goblins jump out of the bushes. 
Roll Initiative.

When the goblins die, the PC can inspect the cart. Whilst there isn't much of value, there is around 5gp and an advertisement for the yawing portal. Reading:

"

"

At this point the pc can fuck around a bit or continue his journey towards waterdeep.




# A demon's best friend

A couple miles further down the road the PC has another encounter. 

The pc sees an old man sitting alone alongside the road, looking almost dead, but can visibly be seen breathing, coughing and dozing around. 
Inspection from far away reveals nothing.

If pc wants to walk past the man the man screams and gasps at him when he walks past pleading for help. 
The man normally asks for help as well if approached normally. 

"The man looks you straight in the eye and says that his wife got hurt deeper in the forest, he asks you to go with him and help her out. Alone he can't do anything. Whilst he says this you get an off-putting feeling from the man."

Suggest survival check to see if there's anything noticeable. 
High enough dc results in the following:
"Whilst he was looking you in the eyes, you saw something strange. They appeared to be empty, housing nothing, as if he's just a walking husk of a man. The off-putting feeling gets stronger, becoming familiar."

Suggest history check as to why it's familiar.
High enough dc results in the following:
"That day when your village got horribly attacked, the demons exuded some aura, you could feel them. Whilst he doesn't give off that exact vibe, it's eerily close."

The pc can help by going in the forest where he's promptly attacked by a dretch.
If you instantly fight or walk away, a dretch will leap out of the bushes to attack.

make it a bit easier

```statblock
monster: Dretch
```

After killing the dretch, you find nothing of value. You do however find tracks leading toward waterdeep. Eventually the tracks fade away, but you can clearly determine that they originated towards waterdeep. 




# Arriving at waterdeep

When arriving at the gates of waterdeep you're stopped by 2 guards. You look roughed up by the fighting and travelling for quite some time.

"Hey stop, why is filth like you trying to get into our city looking like this. You look like you've been dragged through the mud for a week."

"Tell you what, for 3 gold we'll let you in."

An insight check can let you know he's bluffing
A history check can let you know it's almost unheard of for a city to ask an entry fee. 


Just RP

When the PC gets through the gate go to the next section



# The yawning portal
When arriving in the yawning portal the PC is greeted by Durnan. 

The advertisment can lead to the following line:

"Oh looking for some good work are you, you can take a seat at that table over there." 
He points to a table with CURRENT PEOPLE sitting at it.

The PC can do anything but sitting at the table ends the session. 

"You take a seat at the table and wait, until the rest of the seats get filled."
"You take the last seat at the table and wait, until someone approaches."

Upon first contact with the stone the person making contact with it hears a voice inside their head proclaiming: "The path cannot be seen without the eyes". The holders vision goes black and very quickly they see 3 rooms, 1 being inside of a dingy dungeon, with dirt on the floor and dripping stones on the ceiling, looking from inside a glass box towards a wooden door. The 2nd room shows a POV from a pedestal. The surrounding room seems almost otherwordly as if in a other dimension. The POV is pitch black with only some ligt coming through some cracks in front.

Legend Lore. 
The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the legend lore spell. By using the stone to cast legend lore, you communicate directly with the stone, and it shares its knowledge with you. The stone can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague. 



The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three eyes are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures.

Blinkshot are arrows with suction cups instead of normal arrowheads with rope attached which pull you to your shot location. (grappling hook)
(Sold in pairs)

(Needs a bow to work)
(Bow sold separately)


A blinkshot can be fired as a bonus action, pulling (teleporting) the shooter to the location they stuck to.
A blinkshot arrow does no damage due to the fact that it's not pointy. 

Blinkshot uses complex magic bound to the gravity of the moon, but can only do this once per day.
It recharges at midnight when the moon is shining bright.

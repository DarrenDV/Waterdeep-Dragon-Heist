A highly sought-after potion that, when consumed, grants the drinker the ability to temporarily assume the appearance and abilities of another individual, providing a form of shapeshifting.


Costs 1 action, lasts 1 minute

You assume the appearance and innate abilities the target has. i.e. race specific or class specific if you share the same class. 
You still use your own resources like spell slots and HP.  
You will gain the appearance but not the abilities of any magic item carried by the target.
The target has to be a individual creature who's form is humanoid.

![[Robe of eyes.jpg|500]]

This yellow robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

- The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.
- You have [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.
- You can see [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible) creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.


A **[light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light)** spell cast on the robe or a **[daylight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/daylight)** spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for **[light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light)** or DC 15 for **[daylight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/daylight)**), ending the blindness on a success.

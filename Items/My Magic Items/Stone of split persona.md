10 charges, 1d4 per day, uses 6 on activation.

The user points the stone towards anyone, and is able to take a personality away from them and project it as a clone. 
i.e. split someones niceness and evilness. ying yang type stuff. 
The taken personality is under full control of the one holding the stone. 
Both personalities can interact and talk with another should the holder allow it. 
The personality remains in the orb until the holder releases it. 
The personality can only be used for 1 minute any activation. 




If the stone is used on lucyus, his sister will be pulled out of him instead of a personality. 
Removing his sister will leave him as a regular sorcerer without any wild magic traits.

Lucy can be interacted with, used for interaction, or used in combat like any person.
She has the same spellset as lucyus. Any spell she casts activates a random wild magic effect.

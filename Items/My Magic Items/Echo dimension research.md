The more echo dimension power you harness the stronger you, and the voices, will become:

Harness tier 1 - Siebren current
Harness tier 2 - You can inflict the power of the voices onto other people. Casting a spell that requires a wisdom or intelligence saving throw has a +1 to spell save dc.
Harness tier 3 - Mind Battery: Some people are not resilient to the power of the echo dimension, whenever someone rolls a nat 1 on a spell saving throw caused by you, the spell effectively crits, allowing you to roll double the amount of damage dice


Harness tier x - You can shatter the boundries of the echo dimension, manipulating them to your own accord.

The more echo dimension power you harness the stronger you, and the voices, will become:

Furthering ones harnessing of the echo dimension has a chance to increase mental strain. Roll a intelligence saving throw . DC = 8 + level + new harness tier
Failing the saving throw adds a negative boon: 
* Boon 1: sometimes, the voices win. When rolling a nat 1: instead of simply failing, the forces of the echo dimension influence the world in a different way. 
* Boon 2: Fragmented Dreams. Your sleep is frequently disturbed by echoes of the dimension. You have difficulty achieving restful sleep, causing you to wake up feeling mildly fatigued. This results in a permanent -1 penalty to your maximum hit points.
- Boon 3: Echoing Whispers. You occasionally hear faint whispers from the echo dimension, distracting you in stressful situations. You suffer a permanent -1 penalty to initiative rolls.    
- Boon 4: Distorted Vision. The influence of the echo dimension causes momentary distortions in your vision. You have a permanent -1 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks.
- Boon 5: Temporal Lag. Your perception of time is occasionally disrupted. You have a permanent -1 penalty to Dexterity saving throws.
- Boon 6: Flickering Presence. Your connection to the echo dimension causes your presence to occasionally flicker, making it harder to maintain concentration. You have a permanent -1 penalty to concentration checks to maintain spells or effects.

Harness tier 1 - Siebren current
Harness tier 2 - You can inflict the power of the voices onto other people. Casting a spell that requires a wisdom or intelligence saving throw has a +1 to spell save dc.
Harness tier 3 - Mind Battery: Some people are not resilient to the power of the echo dimension, whenever someone fails a intelligence or wisdom saving throw imposed by you, they can become frightened if you choose so. They will be frightened until the beginning of your next turn. You can do this once per day. 


Harness tier 4 - 
You can manipulate the boundaries of the echo dimension, being able to create your very own echo pocket dimension. 
You can travel to this pocket dimension whenever you want with whoever you want to store items, chill or whatever when ___not in combat___. 
Once per day ___during combat___, you can use an action to bring yourself and up to 2 other entities to this dimension for whatever purpose. If the creature is not willing to move, they have to fail a contested intelligence check to "get sucked in". Keeping any amount of creatures in here against their will requires concentration. The trapping ends after 5 turns (including the turn where you cast it).

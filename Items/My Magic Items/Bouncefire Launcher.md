The Bouncefire Launcher is a crossbow that magically imbues the bolts/arrows it fires with the power of ricochet. 

Arrows can bounce __once__ of off walls or bounce off of an enemy when the enemy is not hit.

The shooter can target an enemy with the intent to make the shot ricochet, thus not damaging that target. 

When the ATK roll is too low < 10? (d20 <= 3) ACTUALLYMAYBECHANGE, the shot will bounce back toward a random teammate (including you) dealing the average attacks full damage (+ any modifiers) / 2 rounded down. ACTUALLYMAYBECHANGE
For example: (1d6+3) = 3 damage.

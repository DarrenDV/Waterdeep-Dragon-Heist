![[Pipes of the sewers.png|500]]

These wooden pan-pipes are decorated with carved reliefs of hundreds of scuttling rats.

This pipe has "Charges". A maximum of 8. 

At will you can summon a swarm of rats to help fight in an encounter. They will scurry away after the combat encounter. 
You can also summon them and give them a single command out of combat. 
Summoning does not cost an action but 6 charges. 

During combat these rats share your initiative roll. 

Every dawn, you gain 1d4 charges.

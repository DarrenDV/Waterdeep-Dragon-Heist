This is a list of "rules" set out to follow in [[Prehevil]]'s forest. These rules have been discovered during multiple expeditions and, while possibly not being the complete list, will help any adventuring party avoid nasty encounters. 


# Rules 


##### Follow the wind

	At all times you need to let the wind guide you

	Failing to follow the wind will result in the party encountering a set of fog monsters
	4 steam mephits appear

```statblock
monster: Steam Mephit
```



##### Sing a song to the whispering leaves

	The leaves are restless and grow angry, singing a nice song should calm them down.

	The party needs to do a collaborative performance. Let them decide how to do it but everybody needs to be involved. Determine DC based on work. Failing to meet any criteria will result in an attack by a shambling mound with half hp. 

```statblock
monster: Shambling Mound
```

##### Do as the bell tolls

	A faint bell starts ringing from the distance. 
	One toll, run away for it is far.
	Two tolls, move as a mouse for it draws near.
	Three tolls, hide and good luck. 

	Everyone can decide to do a roll or not, not doing a roll or failing one will result in it being the next bell toll. The encounter can start on whatever bell toll.
	Check one will require an athletics check for endurance, DC LOW
	Check two will require a performance check for mouse like movement, DC mid
	Check three requires a stealth check, DC high unless roleplayed cool. 

[[Defeating the bell]] 




##### Don't stare at the flies of fire

	Sometimes fireflies pop up in swarms,
	The purple ones warp your mind.

	Don't look at purple fireflies 
	Else wisdom save Good dc
	Punishment random curse from bestow curse up until the next fight is over




##### The roots can feel you

	Some trees are alive and don't like being disturbed.

	When offroading, request a random PC to do a acrobatics or survival check to avoid stepping on trees. 
	Failing to do so will in turn make the party be attacked by 3 of every blight




##### Don't create food

	Residents of the forest are hungry, 
	Don't create food

	When killing organic enemies, the PC has a short amount of time before others show up attracted by the sound of battle and smell of fresh kill.


```statblock
monster: Gibbering Mouther
```
 Or 3 zombies
```statblock
monster: Zombie
```

Or 1

```statblock
monster: Wereboar
```


##### Avoid getting caught in the webs

	Whilst not visible, some webbing lies around
	If you don't escape quickly you'll get pound

	Choose at a random time some random PC's to make a dex saving throw DC 14
	Some failes later introduce 6-7 chitine

##### Stick to the path

	You don't know what lurks in the mist

	Throw random enemies their way

```statblock
monster: Flesh Golem
```


##### Mind your step

	A small hole could be enough to end it all

	Throw a DC 13 dex saving throw towards the entire party. Everyone who fails falls in hole with 2 swarms of rot grubs

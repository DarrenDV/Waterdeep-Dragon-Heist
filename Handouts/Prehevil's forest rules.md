This is a list of "rules" set out to follow in [[Prehevil]]'s forest. These rules have been discovered during multiple expeditions and, while possibly not being the complete list, will help any adventuring party avoid nasty encounters. 


# Rules 


##### Follow the wind

	At all times you need to let the wind guide you

	Failing to follow the wind will result in the party encountering a set of fog monsters??? STILLNEEDTODECIDE


##### Sing a song to the whispering leaves

	The leaves are restless and grow angry, singing a nice song should calm them down.

	The party needs to do a collaborative performance. Let them decide how to do it but everybody needs to be involved. Determine DC based on work. Failing to meet any criteria will result in an attack by blights STILLNEEDTODECIDE. Let STILLNEEDTODECIDE needle blights have the first move.


##### Do as the bell tolls

	A faint bell starts ringing from the distance. 
	One toll, run away for it is far.
	Two tolls, move as a mouse for it draws near.
	Three tolls, hide and good luck. 

	Everyone can decide to do a roll or not, not doing a roll or failing one will result in it being the next bell toll. The encounter can start on whatever bell toll.
	Check one will require an athletics check for endurance, DC LOW
	Check two will require a performance check for mouse like movement, DC mid
	Check three requires a stealth check, DC high unless roleplayed cool.

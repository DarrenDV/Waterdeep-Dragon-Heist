A large logbook filled with schematics and notes about the creation of the nimblewright, some specific subsections however do seem to catch your eye.

A page in the beginning of the book called "A good starting point"

A page in the middle of the book called "Unlocking the potential"

A page in the end of the book called "Finalizing the nimblewrigth"


## A good starting point 
I never expected to find such a detailed robotics schematic when we raided that force gray convoy. 
This schematic for an automated guard unit seems really promising, although it definitely has some areas to improve on. 
Firstly it's not that great for most tasks outside of being a combat unit, it's quite slow and clunky, really precipitable to rust and rot. 
It will take some time but this will become an amazing all purpose unit.

## Unlocking the potential 
The gnomes were stuck on finding the right material to make the new engine out of, but after some careful consideration we can use an engine of a special alloy made by the gnomes. It'll be more durable so we can throw more energy towards it. 
The best part is is that it's very interchangeable, as long as we have an intact engine we can change an older one from any unit out with the new one. 
That extra spunk should give it the boost it needs

## Finalizing the nimblewright 
The nimblewright is complete!
That new engine did the trick. 
By placing it and removing all the excess fat, so to speak, from the original unit we have created an incredibly fast moving automaton. The old one looks like a giant rust bucket compared to these new ones. 
I've arranged mass production to begin shortly and we'll sell them off around the gold coast.
Who knows, maybe the guards will buy them off of us.

# Waterdeep-Dragon-Heist


For any future reference to see how I did things there are a couple of things to note.

1. The original project structure was way more ambitious than I originally had in mind.
	1. What this means is that most folders I ultimately did not really populate that well, these being:
		1. Characters
		2. Factions Guilds and Groups
		3. Locations 
	2. I am autistic enough to actually remember every important plotpoint and character, and too lazy to write them down
	3. Locations just ended up integrated into chapters
2. Most chapters scenes are not written with a mark for order (i.e. 1 -> 2 -> 3)

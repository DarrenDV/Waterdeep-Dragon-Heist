Q1: A deal is offered, in trade for owning what you did and incriminating another person you can have a lighter sentence or even be free (depending on what you're accused of). Do you accept the deal and who do you incriminate?

Q2: You probably know the crimes you can be accused of, do you have any key arguments as to why the accusation is unjust?

Q3: Do you plead guilty to any of the crimes? Doing so will probably lessen your sentence, but will instantly close that case. Pleading not guilty and still being found guilty will give the maximum punishment.

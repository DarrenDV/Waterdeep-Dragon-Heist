Trollskull Manor is an currently an old abandoned building inside of [[Trollskull Alley]]. It used to be a bar before a fireball set the entire place ablaze and the owners left. 

From the outside, Trollskull Manor looks like a big burnt down building and whilst structurally intact, shows no signs of occupancy. 

Trollskull Manor is 4 stories tall boasting balconies, 5 chimneys and a large tavern on the ground floor. 

Trollskull Manor is inhabited by a ghost named [[Lif]].  

The top floor has a permanently locked chest containing: POSSIBLEEXTRASTUFF
This chest will only unlock upon killing or befriending [[Lif]] 


# UNRENOVATED LOOK
When PC's first enter they arrive in the tavern portion of the bar. They find a big room with broken furniture, tarnished silverware, casks of wine that have turned into vinegar and worthless junk. 
The other rooms are all empty, expect for cobwebs, dust and harmless rats. 



# LIF
The entire building is haunted by a poltergeist named [[Lif]], the previous barkeep. 
lt invisibly causes mischief at the expense of the new owners by smashing plates, breaking beer barrels, and so forth. If the characters don't take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as "Closing time!" and "Last call!") on dusty floors and grimy windows.
To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.

## Appeasing Lif
If the characters open the bar he'll gradually become more friendly up to the point where he'll become a worker and help run the bar.

## Destroying [[Lif]] 
You can kill him, if he reaches half health he'll run towards an upper room and fight to the death there

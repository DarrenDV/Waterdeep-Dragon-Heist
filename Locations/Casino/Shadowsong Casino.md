_Location:_ Waterdeep's Dock Ward, under the subtle but influential ownership of the Xanathar guild.

_Exterior:_ The exterior of Shadowsong Casino is adorned with dimly lit lanterns that cast a mysterious glow, creating an inviting yet enigmatic atmosphere. The entrance features a grand façade with intricate designs, hinting at the allure of the games within.

_Entrance and Front Desk:_ As guests enter through the gates, they are greeted by a grand front desk where attendants clad in bright red, elegant attire assist them. The front desk serves as the gateway to the main hall, where the heart of the casino beats with excitement.

_Main Hall:_ The main hall is expansive, with a high ceiling that seems to disappear into the chandeliers above. The center of the hall is dominated by a cluster of lavish table games, including Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Lucky Number Seven, and Slots. The tables are surrounded by plush chairs and subtly lit by strategically placed chandeliers, creating an intimate yet vibrant gaming environment.

_Second Floor:_ Ascending a grand staircase, guests find themselves on the second floor. Here, the casino expands into a labyrinth of additional gaming rooms and entertainment spaces. In the middle of the second floor, an open area provides a view down to the main hall below. Suspended above this open space is a luxurious office, overseeing both floors. This office serves as the nerve center for the casino's operations, and only the most trusted individuals are permitted entry.

_Décor and Ambiance:_ Throughout Shadowsong Casino, the décor is a blend of opulence and mystery. Dark, rich colors dominate the interior, accented by silver and gold details. Shadows dance across the walls, creating an ever-shifting ambiance that adds to the sense of unpredictability and excitement.

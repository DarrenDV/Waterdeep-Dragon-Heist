The gnome lowers a pipe and exhales a cloud of lavender smoke before raising a hand. "Hail and well met! Come browse the shelves of the most curious curiosity shop in the world!" "

The shop is named after the stuffed beholder in the window-a fixture that is actually a magical sensor, through which Xanathar can peer whenever it wishes.

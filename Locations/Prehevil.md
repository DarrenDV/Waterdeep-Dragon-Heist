Prehevil is a small settlement / hamlet on the outskirts of a mysterious forest that houses an old abandoned alchemists tower.

The small settlement houses around 70 people total. Everyone knows eachother. Most of the citizens are quite old, around 50-60 years old. There are a couple of middle aged people, there are no children however. 

The town consists of mostly homes, but there are a couple of notable buildings: 
* An inn
* A forge
* Some guard stations, these are weirdly positioned at the entrance of the forest however, as if to protect them from something within the forest. 

Most of the buildings are made out of old wood, seemingly at least a couple of decades old. The only reinforced structure in sight are the small guard towers at the border with the forest. 

Almost everyone aside from the shopkeepers seem distrustful of adventurers and will try to ignore them. 

Due to being a small settlement, and seemingly not even known on the map, almost every basic equipment can be bought, but at double the cost. 


Prehevil is surrounded by a thick fog which is only visible to people who've been inside of Prehevil or its neighbouring forest.



# Mood
The mood in Prehevil is quite gloomy, with most people ignoring the party, or at least not going out of their way to interact with them. 

In reality, this isnt the first time some adventurers have shown up, it happens once every few years. But at least up until now, they've never returned once attempting to leave. The villagers simply ignore the adventurers because in their eyes, they'll most likely die quite soon and are not worth it to get emotionally attached to. 



# Death
Dying in Prehevil will result in the corpse sinking into the ground, almost melting. The corpse will turn up somewhere inside of the forest. This is after around a minute of death. 

Corpses in Prehevils forest will turn into a monster.

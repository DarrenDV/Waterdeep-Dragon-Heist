Wayfarer's Bazaar is a travelling market that just arrived in Waterdeep. The market will be present for the remainder of the campaign.

"When coming up to the large open marketplace. You see it covered in booths, stalls and numerous party tents. The market is bustling with people, you've probably never seen a portion of the city as busy as this. Between all the stalls are large carriages transporting numerous crates and people. Between the people you see a lot of different races from the realms, from more common ones such as gnomes, dwarfs and elves to rarer ones such as tabaxi, walking cat-like humanoids, aarakocra's, falcon-like humanoids who guard the skies, to satyr, goat-like humans with hooves and hornes, keen on making music and entertaining to many more.

From afar you can see that the market is split up in mutliple districts:

* You see a large amount of people looking at multiple rug and carpet salesmen, of which the patterns are very eastern looking.
* Furhter down the isle of gorceries you see some vendors selling rare plants and other ingredients for alchemy
* Next to those stalls are some tents selling potions, one stands out from the rest because of the amount of people it attracts, mostly adventurers, called "Herbal Haven"
* A large crowd of young, in school uniform dressed people are gathered around a medium sized dark blue tent called Arcane Curiosities

Wayfarer's Bazaar is a travelling market that just arrived in Waterdeep. The market will be present for the remainder of the campaign.

"When coming up to the large open marketplace. You see it covered in booths, stalls and numerous party tents. The market is bustling with people, you've probably never seen a portion of the city as busy as this. Between all the stalls are large carriages transporting numerous crates and people. Between the people you see a lot of different races from the realms, from more common ones such as gnomes, dwarfs and elves to rarer ones such as tabaxi, walking cat-like humanoids, aarakocra's, falcon-like humanoids who guard the skies, to satyr, goat-like humans with hooves and hornes, keen on making music and entertaining to many more."

"As said in front of you is this large market. But siebren, when looking around you see another market stall a bit off the beaten path. Directly to your right, a stall stands in the shadows, keeping a fair amount of distance from the main market. A sign next to it reads "The Mysteria Cabinet"."





Let the players explore the market and 

From afar you can see that the market is split up in mutliple districts:
* Normal citizens of waterdeeps can be seen walking towards a grouping of stalls focused around exotic fruits, vegetables and other groceries
* You see a large amount of people looking at multiple rug and carpet salesmen, of which the patterns are very eastern looking.
* Furhter down the isle of gorceries you see some vendors selling rare plants and other ingredients for alchemy
* Next to those stalls are some tents selling potions, one stands out from the rest because of the amount of people it attracts, mostly adventurers, called "Herbal Haven"
* A large crowd of young, in school uniform dressed people are gathered around a medium sized dark blue tent called Arcane Curiosities
* A forge named Ironclad outfitters where a bunch of armored people are walking in and out of. 
* Around a large tree, you see a tent set up filled with wooden and mossy designs, the sign made out of moss and wood reads: Lightfoot armory. 
* Standing at the outer edge of the market, in some shadows is a small stand populated by some drow. You see the name [[Bregan D'aerthe]] on a sign next to it. A drow next to it is holding a sign reading "INVENTIONS" with an arrow pointing toward the stand. 



### The mysteria cabinet 
The stall is unassuming, with a simple, faded wooden sign hanging above, displaying its name. It's tucked away in a corner, not immediately visible from the main walkway. Only those who are curious or have heard whispers about its unique offerings tend to find their way to this shadowy corner of the market.

Within the tent, an eclectic collection of items is displayed on worn velvet drapes. The lighting is dim, with softly flickering candles in the corners. A dense, mystical scent of incense lingers in the air. 

When walking into the stall, a deep voice can be heard coming from the counter "Welcome adventurers, welcome to the mysteria cabinet. Where dreams become true and there are more magic items than normal ones."

The voice is that of Rich Nix. A small dwarf who is rounder than taller. His bulldog like cheeks make him speak very loosly. He speaks vague and tries to not disclose what the magic items do exactly.

"Please take a look at my curious wares. But you are not allowed to touch or use them before buying."

The store is littered with a bunch of curiosities. Some noticeable are:

* **Robe of items (100gp)**: A robe with many pockets, who knows what's inside? They are all empty except for 1 containing 2gp.
* Chimes of Wind Detection (33gp): These chimes make a calming sound when blown by the wind
* Sword of Bloodletting (75gp): A sword
* Boomerang of Returning (100gp)
* A ring of inn visibility (150gp): A small ring with a gem in the shape of an eye on it. shows you the location of the nearest Inn
* A ring of demon repulsion (200gp): A small ring with some horns on it. The storekeeper says when looking at it "I have worn this ring for all my life, and not once have I crossed paths with a demon. It works wonders!". It's a scam
* Rock of gravity (25gp). Hold the rock out at arms length and drop it. This not only tells you whether or not you are within a gravitational field, but also which way the gravitational field is oriented!
* 2 rings of armor sharing (225 gp). One person suffers a -2 penalty armor loss whilst someone else gains 2. Everytime someone gets hit, the other receives 2 necrotic damage. 
* Throwing daggers of returning (137gp) These throwing daggers return to their holster once thrown
* **Crown of Insatiable Knowledge (400gp):** This crown allows the wearer to gain proficiency in any skill or tool of their choice, but it also permanently lowers their Intelligence score by 2 each time it's used.


Rich Nix also has a small quest for the party. All the other market stalls stand in debt with Rich, he wants that debt to be repayed. The party needs to get 1250 gold (250 from each stall) to settle this debt. It can either be in gp or items. The party will receive a hand mirror of loss for completing this task. 




### Ironclad outfitters
At one of the edges of the bazaar a large amount of smoke can be seen billowing upwards.

Walking toward the smoke you see it's a large tent with a mobile cart-attached forge. The name on the side of the tent: "Ironclad Outfitters"

When walking into ironclad outfitters you see a bunch of people browsing swords, hammers, axes, shield, armors, you name it. If it's made from metal and ready for a fight it's probably there. 
When walking into the store you hear a constant clanking of a hammer against an anvil further down into the store. And above you hangs a large cloud of smoke from the forge, escaping through numerous holes cut in the roof of the tent. 

Behind a counter you see 2 dwarfs hammering away making new equipment to sell to customers. One is a smaller blue-tinted dwarf named Brock and next to him is a larger, more thin, green-hued dwarf named Sindri. Brock speaks rough and sindri gentle. GOD OF WAR. 

The dwarf sell all armor for a normal price.

Walking towards the docks where the flyers pointed to you see a multitude of huge ships nested at the bay, all donning the same flags and banners. 

Arriving near the boats you can see that a large portion of the dock has been split off with fencing, decorated with arrows pointing to an entry further down the docks. From above the fencing you can see that the circus that was present is being taken down however. (ASKING ANY NPC WILL REVEAL THAT THE TIME IS UP, YOU CAN STILL EXPLORE AND TALK THO)

Getting at the gate the party is being waved through, mostly due to the fact that all of the attractions are being dissasembled and won't be set up again until next year.

Asking any NPC whats going on or deeper questions about the situation will point them to their boss in charge, Jarlaxle Baenre

Jarlaxle is the leader of the gang known as [[Bregan D'aerthe]] and whilst they seem friendly, they are deeply corrupt in nature and strive to make the most amount of money possible.
Jaxarle does not know about the stone of golorr and what the niblewrights are up to but will be intriqued when inquired by the party. He does have a list of customers and can give visual descriptions but only for 500 gold. He also has the option to see what every nimblewright is up to and will learn about the stone whenever that happens. 

Just rp a bunch here
